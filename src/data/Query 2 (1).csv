January 6, 2025 Funding Overview The Childcare Access and Nutrition Systems (CANS) Grant Program is funded through a cooperative agreement between the U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development (USDA RD) and the Southeast Crescent Regional Commission (SCRC). USDA Rural Business Cooperative Service provided the funding to SCRC to advance regional food and childcare systems in the distressed-identified rural counties of Dougherty and Upson, Georgia. The SCRC geographic area stretches from the Tidewater part of eastern Virginia southward through the Carolinas along Interstate 95, west through Georgia and lower Alabama, and northwesterly to the Mississippi Delta. According to a recent Wallet Hub economic study, Georgia is the sixth most financially distressed state in the country and has the ninth most people with accounts in distress and the 10th highest average number of accounts in distress across the United States. Georgia&#8217;s Southeast Crescent region is mostly rural, offering natural beauty, a distinct cultural heritage and relative proximity to metropolitan Atlanta, which is the leading economic driver of the state. While most counties in Georgia are economically distressed, the changing demographics of the region, ranging from high-growth areas to those that are losing population, require special interventions and policies to help close the region&#8217;s development and economic growth gap. This grant program will support rural Georgia communities&#8217; economic development efforts and maintain and improve a healthy Georgia population by leveraging funding assistance from the USDA RD to key Administration priorities, such as advancing racial equity place-based growth, and opportunity by ensuring rural residents in the most distressed communities in Georgia have equitable access to RD programs and benefit from RD funded projects. Funding Strategy &#8226; Target Multiple Sectors: The strategic investment in childcare will support an increase in workforce participation. Comparable investment in food production and sustainable farming ends food insecurity and supports sustainability, while positively contributing to multiple facets of rural life. &#8226; Increase Local Food Production: By engaging local farms and food related businesses, and encouraging sustainable food system practices, these projects will support job creation, economic growth, and better health outcomes. Local food production can improve regional self-sufficiency and contribute to long-term economic stability. &#8226; Leverage Employer and Community Partnerships: Through employer and community partnerships, these projects will encourage local support, thus ensuring that both businesses and communities have a stake in the success of the project and its broader implications. &#8226; Scalable Impact: Funded projects will offer an investment in local communities while impacting a broader audience. By expanding access to stronger local food systems and improving access to childcare services, these projects address immediate infrastructure needs, building a foundation for long-term community resilience.

Recipients will work with their partners to use evidence-based interventions (EBIs) to increase screening in people aged 45 to 75 years old. The focus is on populations that have low screening prevalence and experience barriers to screening. Partner clinics must have screening prevalence below the national, regional, or local average. Programs should emphasize identifying populations that have lower screening prevalence or clinic sub-populations who may need more support to complete the screening process. To implement the program recipients will do all the following: Establish partnerships with health systems and primary care clinics to implement at least three multicomponent EBIs recommended in The Community Guide. These EBIs must focus on different areas of the clinical system (such as increasing demand, increasing access, and increasing delivery of screening recommendations). Establish partnerships with organizations that support implementing EBIs, improving data collection, and enhancing use of electronic health records (EHRs) in primary care clinics to increase CRC screening. Conduct a formal readiness assessment of each partner clinic&#8217;s capacity to implement EBIs. Use this assessment to select EBIs that will support improved CRC screening. Make sure clinics have a CRC screening champion in the clinic. Use a limited amount of funding to pay for stool-based testing in partner clinics and to ensure follow-up colonoscopies occur after a positive or abnormal screening test, as a payor of last resort. Submit high-quality, clinic-level data, including baseline and annual CRC screening prevalence, aggregate data on stool-based tests provided to and returned by patients, and aggregate data on follow-up colonoscopies including those supported by the program. Make sure health systems and clinics develop the capacity to collect data and track the entire CRC screening process patients undergo. Submit one success story every six months.

See the full posting on NSPIRES for details. Proposers must retrieve the instructions document (zip file) associated with the application package for this opportunity as there is at least one required form that must be attached to the submitted proposal package. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) &#8211; 2024 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2024. In this case &quot;omnibus&quot; means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates (Tables 2 and 3), a table that provides a very top level summary of proposal contents (Table 1), and the full text of the ROSES-2024 &quot;Summary of Solicitation&quot;, may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024. This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table3, respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under &quot;Announcement Documents&quot; the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH24ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on &#8220;C.8 Lunar Data Analysis Program (.pdf)&#8221; to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read &#8220;C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.pdf)&#8221; from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs. Questions concerning general ROSES-2024 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov, but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list.

Despite the Government of Uzbekistan&#8217;s increased efforts to combat Trafficking in Persons crimes, traffickers continue to exploit vulnerable populations, including women, children, and marginalized groups, for forced labor and sexual exploitation. One of the critical barriers to effective enforcement in this area is the significant underreporting of incidents by victims. In Uzbekistan many victims, due to fear of retaliation, lack of trust in the judicial system, cultural norms or a lack of awareness of their rights, are reluctant to come forward. This lack of reporting hampers the ability of law enforcement agencies to accurately assess the scope of the problem, allocate resources effectively, and take appropriate action against perpetrators. Consequently, without adequate victim reporting, enforcement efforts remain severely constrained, leading to a cycle of impunity that perpetuates the issue. To address this issue, Uzbekistan should strengthen its reporting mechanisms, ensuring reporting systems are both victim-centered and culturally sensitive. These systems should include mechanisms for anonymous reporting, comprehensive data collection, and regular assessments to ensure they are effectively capturing the extent of the issue. This notice of funding opportunity aims to support innovative and sustainable projects that address these critical gaps. Projects should focus on enhancing victim protection and assistance, strengthening law enforcement and judicial capacity, improving data collection and analysis, and fostering multi-stakeholder collaboration.

This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) solicits applications for projects funded under the Local and Regional Project Assistance Program, known as the RAISE Grants program. If the FY 2025 Appropriations Act provides additional funding for the RAISE grants program and/or significantly different requirements for National Infrastructure Investment funds, the Department will amend this Notice with guidance on additional requirements.As with previous rounds, funds for the FY 2025 RAISE Transportation program are to be awarded on a competitive basis for projects that will have a significant local or regional impact.The BIL mandates that DOT will award at least five percent of available funds, ($75 million of the $1.5 billion) for the planning, preparation or design of eligible projects.The BIL specifies that not more than 50 percent of funds can be spent on projects located in a rural area with a population equal to or less than 200,000 and not more than 50 percent of funds can be spent on projects located in an urbanized area with a population of more than 200,000. Pursuant to the BIL, no more than 15 percent of the funds made available for RAISE Transportation Discretionary Grants (or $225 million) may be awarded to projects in a single State. Further, pursuant to the BIL, DOT must take measures to ensure an equitable geographic distribution of grant funds, an appropriate balance in addressing the needs of urban and rural areas, and investment in a variety of transportation modes. The BIL requires that FY 2025 RAISE funds are only available for obligation through September 30, 2029. All RAISE funds must be expended by September 30, 2034. As part of the review and selection process described in the Notice of Funding Opportunity, DOT will consider whether a project is ready to proceed with an obligation of grant funds from DOT within the statutory time provided. Under the BIL, no waiver is possible for these deadlines. The BIL allows for up to 20 percent of available funds (or $300 million) to be used by the Department to pay the subsidy and administrative costs for a project receiving credit assistance under the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 1998 (&#8220;TIFIA&#8221;) program, if it would further the purposes of the RAISE Transportation Discretionary Grant program. Recipients of prior RAISE, BUILD or TIGER Discretionary Grants may apply for funding to support additional phases of a project awarded funds in earlier rounds of this program. However, to be competitive, the applicant should demonstrate the extent to which the previously funded project phase has been able to meet estimated project schedules and budget, as well as the ability to realize the benefits expected for the project. DOT expects that each RAISE Transportation Discretionary Grant will be administered by one of the relevant modal administrations, pursuant to a grant agreement between the RAISE Transportation Discretionary Grant recipient and the relevant modal administration.The BIL specifies that RAISE Transportation Discretionary Grants may not be less than $5 million and not greater than $25 million, except that for projects located in rural areas the minimum RAISE Transportation Discretionary Grant size is $1 million. There is no minimum award size for planning projects.",25.50,2025-01-14T16:44:19.2330000,2025-01-14T16:44:19.2330000,

Subject to the availability of funding, Sea Grant anticipates that approximately $1,500,000 will be available to fund aquaculture internships for a period of up to two years through the Sea Grant Aquaculture Internships Program. Federal funds ranging from $100,000-$500,000 may be requested per application. It is anticipated that this funding opportunity will occur on an annual basis, pending federal appropriations. The overall goal of the Sea Grant Aquaculture Internships Program is to provide commercial aquaculture experience for students (attending high school, undergraduate, or graduate school, including community colleges) and other interested individuals at partnering aquaculture operations. Successful proposals will provide hands-on, practical aquaculture work experience. Sea Grant programs and associated partners will administer their specific internship opportunities and funds should be utilized, in part, to fund salaries of interns, intern housing and transportation expenses as appropriate. Successful programs will provide interns with exposure to a variety of tasks associated with the operation of partnering aquaculture-related operations either public or private; enhance future employment opportunities and professional development; demonstrate significant partnership with the aquaculture community; and require documentation/reporting from interns and participating partners regarding internships. Participation of students enrolled in Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) is encouraged. Proposals must include participation and involvement of Sea Grant extension personnel and aquaculture community stakeholders. These investments are consistent with Sea Grant&#8217;s focus area of Sustainable Fisheries and Aquaculture (SFA) and the Sea Grant Network&#8217;s 10-year Aquaculture Vision, both which support NOAA and Department of Commerce aquaculture goals. This competition is open to all Sea Grant Programs. A Sea Grant Program may submit or be a part of more than one application. Programs are encouraged to partner with other Sea Grant Programs and/or other entities such as individuals, State and Tribal Agencies/Organizations, Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), aquaculture industry members and associations, high schools, universities, and colleges, including community colleges. Federal agencies and their personnel are not permitted to receive federal funding under this competition; however, federal scientists and other employees can serve as uncompensated partners or co-Principal Investigators on applications. Federal labs and offices can also make available specialized expertise, facilities or equipment to applicants but cannot be compensated under this competition for their use, nor can the value of such assets be used as match. All projects must take place within the United States or territories or their respective waterways. Applicants must complete and maintain three registrations to be eligible to apply for or receive an award. These registrations include SAM.gov, Grants.gov, and eRA Commons. All registrations must be completed prior to the application being submitted. The complete registration process for all three systems can take 4 to 6 weeks, so applicants should begin this activity as soon as possible. If an eligible applicant does not have access to the internet, please contact the Agency Contacts listed in Section VII for submission instructions. NOAA has created a guide to aid applicants format application packages to eRA, linked here. Prior to registering with eRA Commons, applicants must first obtain a Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) from SAM.gov, if needed (refer to Section IV. Applications and Submission Information, Section C). Organizations can register with eRA Commons in tandem with completing their full SAM and Grants.gov registrations; however, all registrations must be in place by time of application submission. eRA Commons requires organizations to identify at least one Signing Official (SO) and at least one Program Director/Principal Investigator (PD/PI) account in order to submit an application.

Several National Parks located along the U.S. border with Mexico have recently experienced serious resource damage due to illegal cross border activities including drug traffickers and undocumented persons traversing the parks. Other national park units within the desert southwest have also experienced impacts to their natural and cultural resources. Thousands of miles of unauthorized roads and trails have been created, major ecological processes and the migration patterns of wildlife have been disrupted, important historic sites have been vandalized, and archaeological sites have been looted. Program funding is available for conducting scientific research and monitoring of species, as well as conservation, interpretation and preservation projects designed to help protect and preserve natural and cultural resources located near or along our international border. Applicants must work with and benefit an NPS unit in the Intermountain Region along the U.S. &#8211; Mexico border as well as a protected area in Mexico by addressing cultural or natural resource issues shared by both countries. These parks include Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, Big Bend National Park, Amistad National Recreation Area, Palo Alto National Historic Site, Padre Island National Seashore, Saguaro National Park, Tumacacori National Historical Park, Chamizal National Memorial, Coronado National Memorial, and Chiricahua National Monument. Please note that applicants can work with other Intermountain Region parks near the U.S. Mexico Border, or not otherwise listed to support cultural or natural resource issues shared by both countries. The projects and activities will be individually authorized by separate awards, with each project or activity having a separate work plan and budget developed cooperatively between the NPS and the cooperator.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The U.S. Embassy and Consulates in Brazil announces an open competition for organizations to submit ROUND 1 project proposals for funding through the U.S. Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation (AFCP) to carry out an individual project to preserve cultural heritage in Brazil. The deadline for submitting ROUND 1 proposal to the U.S. Embassy and Consulates in Brazil is Friday, December 20, 2024, by 23:59 (Brasilia Time). Submissions received after this date and time will NOT be considered. Full implementation of the program is pending the availability of FY 2025 funds. Interested institutions are urged to consult with the Public Affairs Section of the U.S. Embassy or Consulates as soon as possible for details and guidance on the AFCP 2025 competition. Through the AFCP Program, the Department of State supports projects to preserve cultural heritage in the following three areas: CULTURAL SITES: This might include (but is not limited to) historical buildings and sites, sacred places, monuments, and archaeological sites. Proposals in this category may involve, for example, restoration of an historic building, an archaeological survey as a component of a preservation plan, preservation management planning for a site, or documentation of sites in a region for preservation purposes. CULTURAL OBJECTS AND COLLECTIONS: from a museum, cultural site, or similar institution. This includes archaeological and ethnographic objects, paintings, sculpture, manuscripts, photographic and film collections, and general museum conservation activities. Proposals in this category may involve, for example, conservation treatment for an object or collection of objects; needs assessment of a collection with respect to its condition and strategies for improving its state of conservation; inventory of a collection for conservation purposes; the creation of safe environments for storage or display of collections; or specialized training in the care and preservation of collections. FORMS OF TRADITIONAL CULTURAL EXPRESSION: This includes traditional music, rituals, knowledge, languages, dance, drama, and crafts. Proposal in this category may involve documenting and audiovisual recording of traditional music and dance forms as part of a tradition expression and making the information and recordings available, or support for training in preservation or traditional arts or crafts that are threatened by extinction. AFCP Program Objectives: AFCP was established to help countries preserve cultural heritage and to demonstrate U.S. respect for other cultures. The aim is to preserve cultural sites or objects that have an historical or cultural significance to the cultural heritage of Brazil. AFCP gives top priority to project activities in keeping with international standards for the preservation of cultural heritage. An appropriate preservation activity is one that protects the values of the site, object or collection, or form of traditional cultural expression, as they are understood by stakeholders. Stakeholders may include national, regional, or local cultural authorities, the local community, and others with vested interests in the site and the outcome of a project. Competition Format: The U.S. Embassy and Consulates in Brazil will select proposals through a two-part process. Applicants must first submit a concept note, which is a concise, 3-page concept note designed to clearly communicate a program idea and its objectives before the development of a full proposal application. The purpose of the Concept Note process is to give candidates the opportunity to present program ideas to the U.S. Embassy and Consulates in Brazil for evaluation before the submission of full proposal applications becomes required. Selected applicants will be extended invitations by U.S. Mission Embassy and Consulates in Brazil to convert their concept notes into comprehensive proposal applications following to a review of such notes. B. FEDERAL AWARD INFORMATION Length of Performance Period: 12 to 60 months Number of Awards Anticipated: 1-3 awards.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The U.S. Embassy in Port Louis, Mauritius announces an open competition for non-profit organizations to submit applications to lead a program for women entrepreneurs through the U.S. State Department&#8217;s Academy for Women Entrepreneurs (AWE) program in Mauritius. Please follow all instructions below. Program Objectives: The U.S. State Department&#8217;s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA) established the Academy for Women Entrepreneurs (AWE) an exchange program in 2019 to empower women with the professional skills, networks, and access they need to launch or scale successful businesses. Implemented in nearly 100 countries since 2019, AWE has empowered an estimated 25,000 women entrepreneurs around the world with the professional business skills they need to reach their full economic potential. The AWE program was implemented in 2021 in Mauritius. As a U.S. government exchange program, AWE connects women with U.S.-style learning and expertise to advance business acumen and build stronger ties among women entrepreneurs in different markets. The AWE program partners with Arizona State University&#8217;s Thunderbird School of Global Management (ASU) and the Freeport-McMoRan Foundation, the creators of DreamBuilder, a no-cost online learning platform that teaches AWE participants the fundamentals of business from a U.S. perspective. In 2023, the Department and ASU established a new five-year, public-private partnership to also offer AWE participants advanced courses through the Francis and Dionne Najafi 100 Million Learners Global Initiative. In addition, by networking with local business leaders and U.S. Exchange Alumni, the AWE program includes localized content specific to entrepreneurs&#8217; needs. ECA&#8217;s Office of Academic Programs manages the AWE program and supports U.S. Missions worldwide to leverage the power of local U.S.-government&#8239;Exchange Alumni networks to serve as facilitators, guest speakers, and mentors for the AWE program. Learn more at https://eca.state.gov/awe. The project will include the following objectives: &#8226; Develop a program aimed at increasing entrepreneurial capacity of AWE beneficiaries that will integrate the DreamBuilder (dreambuilder.org) online course or the Najafi 100 Million Learners Global Initiative as one of its key components. The program will encompass facilitated viewing sessions that will provide the participants an opportunity to discuss the topics and to network. The modules may be augmented to localize the context, and to accommodate the topics of guest speaker talks. &#8226; Identify a facilitator(s) to lead discussions, help localize the principles taught and engage in speed mentoring, influencer talks, pitch competitions or trade fairs for women to apply business skills in real-time. &#8226; Create an educational cohort and recruit 25-35 women aged 25 or older to engage in U.S.-style online education with guided facilitation. The awardee will promote the call for participants through traditional and/or social media platforms and organizational networks that would maximize the number of women reached. In consultation with the awarding agency, the awardee will determine additional selection criteria beyond the basic eligibility parameters and devise an application form. The awardee will review and pre-select program participants and in close collaboration with the U.S. Embassy will organize and conduct final interviews to select the participants. &#8226; Foster networks that support participants&#8217; access to peer-to-peer mentorship, business partners, and scaling opportunities with business in the region. The project has the following goal: Provide the selected women entrepreneurs with the skills, resources, and networks needed to start and scale successful businesses. Participants and Audiences: The target audience for this project are Mauritian, Rodriguan and Seychellois women, aged 25 and older who have recently started a business and have about a year experience selling their product or service. Participants should have basic computer skills and have minimal previous business training. B.

How organisms respond to these rapidly changing conditions will have large consequences for the growth, reproduction and fitness of individual organisms, the distribution of species over space and time, the integrity and the composition of natural communities, the yield of domesticated crops and animals, and the incidence and severity of pathogen outbreaks. Consequences such as these are already having major impacts on the US bioeconomy, the world&#8217;s food security, and the ecosystem services provided by living systems to humans. Developing a comprehensive understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of organismal response to climate change will improve our ability to understand adaptive and plastic capacity of species and to predict and to mitigate maladaptive biological responses to rapidly changing environments, thus facilitating the maintenance of species on a changing planet. Most climate change studies to date have lacked integration between investigations of organismal mechanisms of response and eco-evolutionary approaches. This solicitation calls for proposals that integrate the study of organismal mechanisms of response to climate change (ORCC) with eco-evolutionary approaches to better predict and mitigate the effects of a rapidly changing climate on earth&#8217;s living systems. Specific areas of emphasis include but are not limited to integrating physiology and genomics into the next generation of species distribution models; understanding the mechanistic bases of plastic responses to climate change; functional genomics of organismal response to climate change; how biological interactions are affected by climate change; how biological interactions in turn affect organismal responses to climate change; and improving our ability to predict the limits of biological and global resilience as organisms face changing and novel climate conditions. Proposals to the ORCC Solicitation are encouraged that build on NSF&#8217;s investment in growing convergence research by developing integrative, cross-disciplinary approaches that examine the organismal mechanisms that underlie adaptive and maladaptive responses to environmental factors associated with climate change, how these responses affect fitness in changing and/or novel climates and the genetic and evolutionary processes (eco-evolutionary) through which these traits originate, persist, and are transmitted across generations. Further, this solicitation encourages creative approaches to use the results of these foundational research investigations to develop use-inspired ways to address societal challenges in anticipating and managing effects of climate change on organisms across spatial and temporal scales and biological hierarchies. Proposals that do not bridge disciplinary components, that lack a specific focus on mechanisms of organismal response to climate change, that do not integrate organismal mechanistic insights with eco-evolutionary consequences above the level of the individual, or that do not describe a plan for use-inspired applications of foundational research, should be submitted to the &quot;core&quot; or special programs in IOS, OCE, or DEB are not appropriate for submission to this solicitation.

Agency Overview: The Advanced Research Projects Agency &#8211; Energy (ARPA-E), an organization within the Department of Energy (DOE), is chartered by Congress in the America COMPETES Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-69), as amended by the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-358), as further amended by the Energy Act of 2020 (P.L. 116-260): &#8220;(A) to enhance the economic and energy security of the United States through the development of energy technologies that&#8212; (i) reduce imports of energy from foreign sources; (ii) reduce energy-related emissions, including greenhouse gases; (iii) improve the energy efficiency of all economic sectors; (iv) provide transformative solutions to improve the management, clean-up, and disposal of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel; and (v) improve the resilience, reliability, and security of infrastructure to produce, deliver, and store energy; and (B) to ensure that the United States maintains a technological lead in developing and deploying advanced energy technologies.&#8221; ARPA-E issues this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) under its authorizing statute codified at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 16538. The NOFO and any cooperative agreements or grants made under this NOFO are subject to 2 C.F.R. Part 200 as supplemented by 2 C.F.R. Part 910. ARPA-E funds research on, and the development of, transformative science and technology solutions to address the energy and environmental missions of the Department. The agency focuses on technologies that can be meaningfully advanced with a modest investment over a defined period of time in order to catalyze the translation from scientific discovery to early-stage technology. For the latest news and information about ARPA-E, its programs and the research projects currently supported, see: http://arpa-e.energy.gov/. ARPA-E funds transformational research. Existing energy technologies generally progress on established &#8220;learning curves&#8221; where refinements to a technology and the economies of scale that accrue as manufacturing and distribution develop drive improvements to the cost/performance metric in a gradual fashion. This continual improvement of a technology is important to its increased commercial deployment and is appropriately the focus of the private sector or the applied technology offices within DOE. In contrast, ARPA-E supports transformative research that has the potential to create fundamentally new learning curves. ARPA-E technology projects typically start with cost/performance estimates well above the level of an incumbent technology. Given the high risk inherent in these projects, many will fail to progress, but some may succeed in generating a new learning curve with a projected cost/performance metric that is significantly better than that of the incumbent technology. ARPA-E will provide support at the highest funding level only for submissions with significant technology risk, aggressive timetables, and careful management and mitigation of the associated risks. ARPA-E funds technology with the potential to be disruptive in the marketplace. The mere creation of a new learning curve does not ensure market penetration. Rather, the ultimate value of a technology is determined by the marketplace, and impactful technologies ultimately become disruptive &#8211; that is, they are widely adopted and displace existing technologies from the marketplace or create entirely new markets. ARPA-E understands that definitive proof of market disruption takes time, particularly for energy technologies. Therefore, ARPA-E funds the development of technologies that, if technically successful, have clear disruptive potential, e.g., by demonstrating capability for manufacturing at competitive cost and deployment at scale. ARPA-E funds applied research and development (R&amp;D). The Office of Management and Budget defines &#8220;applied research&#8221; as an &#8220;original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge&#8230;directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective&#8221; and defines &#8220;experimental development&#8221; as &#8220;creative and systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience, which is directed at producing new products or processes or improving existing products or processes.&#8221; Applicants interested in receiving financial assistance for basic research (defined by the Office of Management and Budget as &#8220;experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts&#8221;) should contact the DOE&#8217;s Office of Science (http://science.energy.gov/). Office of Science national scientific user facilities (http://science.energy.gov/user-facilities/) are open to all researchers, including ARPA-E Applicants and awardees. These facilities provide advanced tools of modern science including accelerators, colliders, supercomputers, light sources and neutron sources, as well as facilities for studying the nanoworld, the environment, and the atmosphere. Projects focused on early-stage R&amp;D for the improvement of technology along defined roadmaps may be more appropriate for support through the DOE applied energy offices including: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (http://www.eere.energy.gov/), the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (https://www.energy.gov/fecm/office-fossil-energy-and-carbon-management), the Office of Nuclear Energy (http://www.energy.gov/ne/office-nuclear-energy), and the Office of Electricity (https://www.energy.gov/oe/office-electricity). ARPA-E encourages submissions stemming from ideas that still require proof-of-concept R&amp;D efforts as well as those for which some proof-of-concept demonstration already exists. Submissions can propose a project with the end deliverable being an extremely creative, but partial solution. Program Overview: 1. SUMMARY The Disruptive dc Converters for Grid Resilient Infrastructure to Deliver Sustainable energy (DC-GRIDS) program will target transformative technologies that enable a multi-terminal high-voltage direct current (MT-HVDC) transmission macrogrid. It will enable multi-directional power routing, flexible interconnections between existing and new alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) lines, and the easier addition of sustainable energy sources. Furthermore, a MT-HVDC macrogrid would accelerate adoption of offshore power transmission, conversion of high-voltage alternating current (HVAC) corridors to HVDC, and interconnection of the three U.S. electrical grids. This program seeks to enable the rapid expansion of existing grid capacity, while improving resiliency and performance. 2. BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION HVDC lines transport electrical power more efficiently than HVAC lines over long distances, particularly in underground or subsea applications, and may allow for 3.5 times the capacity of existing HVAC rights-of-way. However, there are several barriers to wider HVDC ...",14.98,2025-01-14T16:44:19.4700000,2025-01-14T16:44:19.4700000,

ARPA-E will provide support at the highest funding level only for submissions with significant technology risk, aggressive timetables, and careful management and mitigation of the associated risks. ARPA-E funds technology with the potential to be disruptive in the marketplace. The mere creation of a new learning curve does not ensure market penetration. Rather, the ultimate value of a technology is determined by the marketplace, and impactful technologies ultimately become disruptive &#8211; that is, they are widely adopted and displace existing technologies from the marketplace or create entirely new markets. ARPA-E understands that definitive proof of market disruption takes time, particularly for energy technologies. Therefore, ARPA-E funds the development of technologies that, if technically successful, have clear disruptive potential, e.g., by demonstrating capability for manufacturing at competitive cost and deployment at scale. ARPA-E funds applied research and development (R&amp;D). The Office of Management and Budget defines &#8220;applied research&#8221; as an &#8220;original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge&#8230;directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective&#8221; and defines &#8220;experimental development&#8221; as &#8220;creative and systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience, which is directed at producing new products or processes or improving existing products or processes.&#8221; Applicants interested in receiving financial assistance for basic research (defined by the Office of Management and Budget as &#8220;experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts&#8221;) should contact the DOE&#8217;s Office of Science (http://science.energy.gov/). Office of Science national scientific user facilities (http://science.energy.gov/user-facilities/) are open to all researchers, including ARPA-E Applicants and awardees. These facilities provide advanced tools of modern science including accelerators, colliders, supercomputers, light sources and neutron sources, as well as facilities for studying the nanoworld, the environment, and the atmosphere. Projects focused on early-stage R&amp;D for the improvement of technology along defined roadmaps may be more appropriate for support through the DOE applied energy offices including: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (http://www.eere.energy.gov/), the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (https://www.energy.gov/fecm/office-fossil-energy-and-carbon-management), the Office of Nuclear Energy (http://www.energy.gov/ne/office-nuclear-energy), and the Office of Electricity (https://www.energy.gov/oe/office-electricity). ARPA-E encourages submissions stemming from ideas that still require proof-of-concept R&amp;D efforts as well as those for which some proof-of-concept demonstration already exists. Submissions can propose a project with the end deliverable being an extremely creative, but partial solution. Program Overview: The Quantum Computing for Computational Chemistry program (QC3) aims to harness the transformative power of quantum computing to accelerate energy innovation. Computation plays an essential role in modern R&amp;D, but classical computers struggle to simulate quantum systems with the speed, scale, and accuracy necessary to advance many commercial energy applications. This program will support the R&amp;D of scalable, generalizable quantum computing approaches to computational chemistry and materials science. These approaches will be exponentially faster than the classical computing state-of-the-art (SoA), improving speed, accuracy, or problem size by 100 times (100x). This could result in a cumulative energy impact of 1 quadrillion British thermal units (1 quad), which is equal to a reduction of roughly 1 gigaton of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions from energy-related activities. The development of electronic digital computers sparked revolutionary advances in science. Not only did computers accelerate hand calculations, but they also created entirely new modes of computation from the Monte Carlo methods developed at Los Ala...",13.56,2025-01-14T16:44:19.0470000,2025-01-14T16:44:19.0470000,

Street Medicine Overview As a client-centered service, street medicine is designed to bring the services offered in a clinic into the unsheltered spaces where people live, spend time, and congregate such as the streets and wooded areas. As described by subject matter experts globally, street medicine is conducted where people live and must include a change in traditional health care delivery structure to engage those unstably housed. Street medicine is not a new form of health care delivery. Rather, street medicine programs have existed for decades. These programs have demonstrated the ability to provide health care service in an effective manner, resulting in improved health outcomes. Street medicine programs may take a different approach to address components of delivering health care services than traditional health care settings. Some components are the safety, local and state regulations, and selection of services to offer people. Clinic-based and street medicine interventions have different approaches for assuring safety of the teams providing and clients receiving care due to the different environments and availability of resources in each setting. Local and state regulations may determine which health care services can be delivered in which setting and when. 1. Review 2. Get Ready 3. Prepare 4. Learn 5. Submit 6. Award Contacts Step 1: Review the Opportunity 10 These components are important to understand and include in all street medicine programs. Health care delivered in traditional settings, such as a clinic or mobile unit, may not address the needs of those who are unsheltered. Barriers such as facility hours of operation and policies related to entry (e.g., no pets, no carts, requirements for shirts and shoes) impact access to and retention in care. Stigma and discrimination may be other factors that prevent those with previous poor experiences in clinic-based settings who are unsheltered from entering traditional settings for health care. Because people who are rough sleepers or are unsheltered experience a combination of varied social determinants of health challenges, street medicine teams encounter populations with chronic disease co-morbidities, mental health, substance use disorders, and other structural factors requiring innovative, approaches (see also Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)&#8217;s 2023-2026 Strategic Plan). Based on the 2022 RWHAP Services Report, 5.2% of clients served were unstably housed with another 6.9% temporarily housed. Clients who were unstably housed had a viral suppression of 72.4% and people who were temporarily housed had a viral suppression of 84.1%, which is a lower viral suppression than those who have stable housing. To end the HIV epidemic in the United States, strategies that tailor services to meet the needs of people who are not engaged in care or virally suppressed where they are located are required. Street medicine, as a form of health care delivery, can be an effective intervention to help RWHAP clients who are not well served by traditional health care delivery systems. Therefore, while street medicine focuses on those people who are unstably housed, it can also serve those who are averse to a traditional clinic building environment.",12.37,2025-01-14T16:44:18.8100000,2025-01-14T16:44:18.8100000,

Each Reserve within the NERRS is chosen to represent a different bio-geographic region and to include a variety of ecosystem types in accordance with the classification scheme of the national program as specified in 15 C.F.R. Part 921. By funding Reserve lead agencies and universities to conduct land acquisition and construction projects that support the NERRS mission, NOAA will strengthen protection of key land and water areas, enhance long-term protection of Reserve areas for research and education, and provide for facility and exhibit construction activities that meet the highest sustainable design standards possible. Each Reserve supports a wide range of beneficial uses important to ecological, economic, recreational, and aesthetic values, which are dependent upon the maintenance of a healthy ecosystem. The sites provide habitats for a wide range of ecologically and commercially important species of fish, shellfish, birds, and other aquatic and terrestrial wildlife. Each Reserve was designated to ensure its effectiveness as a conservation unit and as a site for long-term research and monitoring. In maintaining their effectiveness, the Reserves may find it necessary to expand their boundaries through strategically planned land acquisitions and/or to develop or enhance their reserve facilities, including their in-situ monitoring infrastructure, to meet the demands of research, monitoring, and education program objectives. NOAA anticipates approximately $8.5 million in Fiscal Year 2025 will be available to designated lead Reserve agencies or universities in coastal states. NOAA anticipates funding between 5-20 construction, acquisition, and/or planning &amp; design projects. Project periods may be 12-36 months, and can be up to 60 months. Final project selections are subject to availability of funds and negotiation with NOAA. The NOAA Office for Coastal Management (OCM) encourages applicants and awardees to support the principles of diversity and inclusion when writing their proposals and performing their work. Diversity is defined as a collection of individual attributes that together help organizations achieve objectives. Inclusion is defined as a culture that connects each employee to the organization. Promoting diversity and inclusion improves creativity, productivity, and the vitality of the climate research community in which OCM engages.",16.19,2025-01-14T16:44:19.8970000,2025-01-14T16:44:19.8970000,

(Micron) through the Micron Foundation, seek tosupport experiential learning opportunitiesfor individualsfrom all professional and educationalbackgrounds, resulting in increased access to, and interest in, career pathways inemerging technologyfields (e.g.,advanced manufacturing, advanced wireless, artificial intelligence, biotechnology,quantum information science,semiconductors, and microelectronics). As NSF seeks to support the development of technologies in such fields, similar support will be needed to foster and grow a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce comprising and enabling all Americans to contribute to such innovation. Large-scale challenges likeadvances in microelectronics or artificial intelligence also requireaSTEMworkforcethatbringsvaried perspectives and expertise to further accelerate the translation of science and engineering discoveries into large-scale solutions. Moreover, as current and new emerging technologies continue to evolve, unforeseen issues around security, safety and privacy will impact thepreparationof the workforce.Emerging technologiesare also dynamicandrapidly changing, with career entry and advancement often requiring &quot;learning-by-doing&quot; experience, even for those with some STEM education.Therefore, NSF recognizes that a competitiveemerging technology workforcemust includeindividualsfrom traditional and nontraditional education pathways as well as those individuals who may have &#8220;stopped&#8221; out of traditional educational pathways. The ExLENT program willsupport experiential learningopportunitiesdesigned toprovide cohorts of learnerswiththe crucial skills needed to succeed inemerging technologyfieldsand prepare themto enterthe workforce ready to solve our Nation&#8217;smost pressing challenges.Furthermore, theExLENTprogram will directly support NSF&#8217;spriorityto enable all Americans the opportunity to become a part of the emerging technologies workforce1, thereby assuring the Nation&#8217;s competitiveness in STEM. Key goals of the program are to (1) expand access to career-enhancing experientiallearning opportunitiesfor all individuals, including adult learners interested in re-skilling and/or upskilling (e.g., those who face or who have faced significant barriers to accessing a formal STEM education);(2)promotecross-sectorpartnershipsbetweenorganizationsinemerging technologyfields and those with expertise in workforce development;and (3) develop a workforce aligned with regional economies based onemergingtechnologiesacross the Nation, in alignment with the mission of the TIP Directorate.

See the full posting on NSPIRES for details. Proposers must retrieve the instructions document (zip file) associated with the application package for this opportunity as there is at least one required form that must be attached to the submitted proposal package. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) &#8211; 2024 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2024. In this case &quot;omnibus&quot; means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates (Tables 2 and 3), a table that provides a very top level summary of proposal contents (Table 1), and the full text of the ROSES-2024 &quot;Summary of Solicitation&quot;, may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024. This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table3, respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under &quot;Announcement Documents&quot; the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH24ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on &#8220;C.8 Lunar Data Analysis Program (.pdf)&#8221; to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read &#8220;C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.pdf)&#8221; from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs. Questions concerning general ROSES-2024 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov, but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list.

The purpose of USFWS is to protect the natural world so current and future generations can live with, live from, and find awe in lands, waters, and wildlife. USFWS envisions a future where people and nature thrive in an interconnected way and where every community feels part of and committed to the natural world around us. The USFWS International Affairs program works to coordinate domestic and international efforts to protect, restore, and enhance the world&#8217;s diverse wildlife and their habitats with a focus on species of international concern, including domestic species that range or migrate beyond our borders or are traded or trafficked internationally. We envision a world where all people value nature and conserve living resources for the well-being of life on Earth. The USFWS International Affairs program achieves its goals by providing financial support for important projects that achieve clear conservation results for key species and their habitats around the world. Congress passed the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. &#167;5301) in 1994 because they recognized the increasing threats to tigers and rhinoceros and the American people&apos;s commitment to conserving these iconic species. This law helps protect tigers and all rhinoceros species by supporting conservation programs in their habitats. The goal of the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Fund (RTCF) is effective, long-term conservation of rhinoceros and tigers and their habitats. RTCF supports projects that have lasting benefits for Asian rhinoceros and tigers. RTCF funds projects that are designed to increase rhino and tiger populations, manage their habitats, create protected areas, involve local communities and Indigenous peoples in conservation, deal with conflicts between people and wildlife, and educate the public about these animals.This RTCF NOFO invites applications for conservation projects in Asia that have lasting benefits and:Support protected areas and restore habitats where rhinoceros and tigers live in Asia.Ensure strong protections to stop illegal killing and end the illegal trade in live tigers and rhinos, their products, and their body parts.Work with local communities to protect biodiversity, plan how land is used, and provide alternative ways to earn a living that have lasting benefits.Promote coexistence by reducing the negative impacts of humans on Asian rhinoceros and tigers and their habitats, tackling the root causes of conflicts between humans and these animals, and finding solutions to minimize such conflicts.Conduct research on Asian rhinoceros and tiger populations and their habitats, that informs conservation decision-making, including surveys and monitoring.Enforce CITES and other relevant treaties and laws that prohibit or regulate the taking or trade of rhinoceros and tigers or control how their habitats are used and managed.Eliminate the demand for illegal rhinoceros and tiger parts, products, and live animals in countries that consume them.Reintroduce Asian rhinoceros to places where they once lived.Improve cooperation between countries to promote conservation of tigers and Asian rhinoceros across borders.",13.83,2025-01-14T16:44:20.8630000,2025-01-14T16:44:20.8630000,

In 2025 the Colorado BLM is focused on meeting the priorities of the National Seed Strategy (www.blm.gov/seedstrategy).The BLM Colorado Plant Conservation and Restoration Program is especially focused on projects that:protect biodiversity;increase resilience to climate change and help leverage natural climate solutions;contribute to conserving at least 30 percent of our lands and waters by the year 2030;engage communities of color, low income families, and rural and indigenous communities to enhance economic opportunities related to native seed production and restoration;and use the best science and data available to make decisions. Native plants and native plant communities are the true green infrastructure we rely upon to sustain healthy, bio-diverse ecosystems. Without native seed we do not have the ability to restore functional ecosystems after natural disasters and mitigate the effects of climate change.The Colorado BLM has opportunities to work with partner organizations to do activities such as:Reduce the threats to sage grouse, rare plants, and other sensitive species in high priority habitats by supporting efforts to restore habitat for keystone wildlife and pollinator .Working with growers to develop genetically appropriate native plant material for use in habitat restoration and rehabilitation.Support studies to improve the effectiveness of conservation restoration efforts in areas such as plant ecological, plant genetics, and ecophysiological studies, seed bank persistence, plant propagation and development of agronomic production practices, and trait and/or seed source evaluations as well as seeding treatment and tool development.Support pollinator studies and projects on the importance of native plant communities and pollinators to restoration durability and ecological function. Implement conservation actions for high priority rare plant speciesIncrease understanding of rare plant biology and threats.Monitor, protect, and restore habitat that supports more than 1,800 rare plant species, more than 300 of which are found exclusively on BLM lands.Develop strategies to encourage the use of native plant materials that are genetically appropriate for restoration and reclamation across all BLM associated programs such as Wildlife, Oil &amp; Gas, Minerals, Fuels, Emergency Stabilization and Rehabilitation, Range, and Renewable Energy;Increase Citizen Science through expanding public education programs on native plants and native plant communities through development of technical guidance, videos, native plant guides and floras, workshops, webinars, and apps.",16.29,2025-01-14T16:44:20.6300000,2025-01-14T16:44:20.6300000,

While currently available technologies can provide some understanding, they may not be sufficient to accomplish this goal. For example, non-invasive technologies are low resolution and/or provide indirect measures such as blood flow, which are imprecise; invasive technologies can provide information at the level of single neurons producing the fundamental biophysical signals, but they can only be applied to tens or hundreds of neurons, out of a total number in the human brain estimated at 85 billion.Other BRAIN FOAs seek to develop novel technology (RFA-NS-17-003) or to optimize existing technology ready for in-vivo proof-of-concept testing and collection of preliminary data (RFA-NS-17-004) for recording or manipulating neural activity on a scale that is beyond what is currently possible. This FOA seeks applications for unique and innovative technologies that are in an even earlier stage of development than that sought in other FOAs, including new and untested ideas that are in the initial stages of conceptualization.In addition to experimental approaches, the support provided under this FOA might enable calculations, simulations, computational models, or other mathematical techniques for demonstrating that the signal sources and/or measurement technologies are theoretically capable of meeting the demands of large-scale recording or manipulation of circuit activity in humans or in animal models.

In this NOFO, applications are requested for: &#183; Systems-level research to improve understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying bioenergy feedstock productivity under changing and at times suboptimal environmental conditions, &#183; Systems biology-enabled investigations into the role(s) of microbes and microbial communities (including rhizosphere consortia, e.g. bacteria, fungi, diazotrophs, endophytes, viruses) in supporting plant productivity and vigor are also solicited. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION Two areas vital to the Nation&#8217;s energy and environmental security motivate the BER research agenda: developing cost-effective biofuels and bioproducts and improving our ability to understand, predict, and mitigate the impacts of energy production in the face of a variable environment. BER has invested in plant and plant-microbe interactions research with the goal of advancing production of biofuels/bioproducts from domestic lignocellulosic and oilseed crop sources. These efforts have increased our understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying feedstock productivity and facilitated development of next- generation bioenergy crops that utilize novel, efficient bioenergy strategies that can be replicated on a mass scale. However, several knowledge gaps and challenges remain towards attaining the goal of developing vigorous crops with superior growth and yield under varying environmental conditions. A better understanding of the underlying genetic and physiological mechanisms influencing plant productivity, resource use efficiency, and adaptation and resilience to abiotic stress are needed. Also of interest is how beneficial plant-microbe associations may enhance requisite plant processes to enable manipulation of these associations for improving plant traits. Furthermore, available computational technologies and infrastructure may provide opportunities to connect and integrate information across multiple spatial and temporal scales to better understand the behavior of complex biological systems and to develop a predictive understanding of sustainability outcomes over a range of future climate scenarios [U.S. DOE.2014. Research for Sustainable Bioenergy: Linking Genomic and Ecosystem Sciences, Workshop Report, DOE/SC-0167. U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science. https://www.genomicscience.energy.gov/research-for-sustainable-bioenergy-linking-genomic-and-ecosystem-sciences/]. DOE-BER&#8217;s GSP (https://genomicscience.energy.gov/) supports fundamental research to identify the basic principles that drive biological systems. These principles govern translation of the genetic code into integrated networks of proteins, enzymes, regulatory elements, and metabolite pools underlying the functional processes of organisms. The Genomic Science program aims to support the DOE&#8217;s bioenergy development mission by leveraging omics-driven tools and systems biology approaches to address key challenges facing the sustainable production of bioenergy crops as an economically and environmentally viable alternative resource for fuels, chemicals, and products currently produced from fossil fuel resources. This NOFO aims to build upon the advances made since previous BER investments in this area, seeking to apply systems biology and omics technologies to map the complex networks and molecular mechanisms of bioenergy crop growth, development, and metabolism for sustainable and resilient bioenergy crop production. Understanding the multi-organismal &#8220;biofuel crop+soil+microbe ecosystem&#8221; presents a unique challenge, which is further complicated by environmental impacts. The ability to predict plant and microbial species&#8217; responses to a changing environment will be critical to understanding potential environmental impacts as well as for optimizing feedstock production. Applications are solicited for systems biology-driven basic research on the fundamental principles of bioenergy crop production in relationship to the associated environmental context. Species of interest include but are not limited to candidate bioenergy plants (e.g., sorghum, energy cane, Miscanthus, switchgrass, Populus) and non-food oilseed crops (e.g., Camelina). Proposed projects should be hypothesis-driven and focus on understanding productivity and the effects of abiotic stresses and nutrient availability. Such deep understanding will enable the development of bioenergy crops that are tolerant to environmental stressors, require less agronomic inputs, and are resilient and/or adaptable to varying environmental conditions.",16.84,2025-01-14T16:44:20.8670000,2025-01-14T16:44:20.8670000,

The NOFO will specifically support two categories of milestone-driven projects: 1) traditional de novo drug development (i.e., new chemical/molecular entities) with three specific entry points to the translational pipeline (i.e., screening through preclinical validation, hit to lead through IND, or late-stage preclinical development through FIH studies), and 2) data-driven computational drug repurposing strategies with subsequent validation of predictions and generation of proof-of-concept data in pertinent animal models and/or in human in vitro studies.For the purposes of this NOFO, drug repurposing (also known as drug repositioning, reprofiling or re-tasking) refers to approaches for identifying alternative uses for FDA-approved drugs or investigational therapeutics which are beyond the scope of the original intended clinical indication. The types and scale of proposed translational research activities in the projects are anticipated to vary and will depend on whether the project focuses on traditional drug development pathways or involves drug repurposing. The UG3 phase of this NOFO will support T1 translational research planning activities and preliminary studies. Transition to the UH3 phase (based on achievement of UG3 milestones proposed by the investigators) will enable more comprehensive pharmacology and/or toxicology evaluations of the proposed therapeutics, including replication studies to confirm preliminary findings or experimental validation of predictive models.",8.70,2025-01-14T16:44:19.0500000,2025-01-14T16:44:19.0500000,

See the full posting on NSPIRES for details. Proposers must retrieve the instructions document (zip file) associated with the application package for this opportunity as there is at least one required form that must be attached to the submitted proposal package. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) &#8211; 2024 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2024. In this case &quot;omnibus&quot; means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates (Tables 2 and 3), a table that provides a very top level summary of proposal contents (Table 1), and the full text of the ROSES-2024 &quot;Summary of Solicitation&quot;, may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024. This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table3, respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under &quot;Announcement Documents&quot; the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH24ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on &#8220;C.8 Lunar Data Analysis Program (.pdf)&#8221; to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read &#8220;C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.pdf)&#8221; from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs. Questions concerning general ROSES-2024 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov, but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list. Not all program elements are known at the time of the release of ROSES.

Executive Summary The U.S. Embassy Seoul and U.S. Embassy Tokyo are excited to announce a trilateral esports program as part of the 2025 Young Trilateral Leaders (YTL) Network. This program seeks to foster cross-border collaboration among youth aged 20-39 from the United States, Republic of Korea (ROK), and Japan, building on outcomes from recent trilateral summits. Through a combination of virtual and in-person activities, participants will develop key skills such as cross-cultural communication, teamwork, and digital literacy. This cooperative grant program was made possible through a new public private partnership between the Department of State and Coupang, a Fortune 200 technology company headquartered in Seattle, to advance U.S. Government&#8217;s efforts to drive innovation and economic security in the Indo-Pacific region. The program will culminate in an esports competition in the ROK in 2025, with high-performing teams traveling for the final event. In addition to competition, participants will receive training in areas like conflict resolution and leveraging esports for positive social impact. Successful applicants will design a comprehensive plan for recruitment, virtual engagements, and final competition logistics. Proposals should also include a strong monitoring and evaluation component to track the program&apos;s impact on trilateral cooperation. Goals and Objectives This project aims to bring rising leaders together to form trilateral esports teams who will compete together in an esports competition to take place in the ROK in the first half of 2025. A key facet of the program will include training on issues designed to build a cohort of trilateral champions who know how to work with one another across borders, promoting skills such as cross-cultural communication, teamwork, technological literacy, strategic thinking, conflict mediation and resolution, identifying and combatting discrimination in digital spaces, and how gaming -- especially values of sportsmanship and healthy competition -- can be used to make a positive social impact. This project should also raise awareness amongst the general public by asking teams to document their journey training together and collaborating towards a common goal across borders &#8211; producing content that will be shared via social media and other public outlets. Given the international nature of the teams, most of the program may take place virtually, with funding available for some high-performing teams to travel to the ROK for the final competition. The final in-person portion should also utilize Embassy Seoul&#8217;s network of American Spaces as venues for some of the trainings and gatherings. Applications should make a clear link between the program&#8217;s goals and their choice of game(s), which should be limited to those made by Korean, Japanese, or American entities. The winning team will participate in an appropriate follow-on activity, suggested as a trip to the United States to learn about U.S. innovation in eSports education and business as well as the importance of combating online disinformation. The grantee will be responsible for planning and implementing this trip. Target Audience: Korean and Japanese college students and young professionals aged 20-39 from diverse backgrounds who work in gaming, esports, emerging technologies, successful eSports players, or those who have a demonstrated interest in the gaming sector, speak fluent English, and are interested in trilateral collaboration. Participants must be comfortable appearing in Embassy and YTL social media and other digital products about the competition. The total number of participants should be adjusted based on the available budget. Participants should reflect the United States government&#8217;s commitment to diversity, inclusion, equity, and accessibility Location: Most portions leading to the final eSports competition can take place virtually. The final competition must take place in the ROK in the first half of 2025. As a cooperative grant, Embassy Seoul will maintain substantial involvement in the selection of a local partner to host the competition. Timeline: Successful proposals should include a defined recruitment period, series of virtual engagements, social media and digital outreach plan, and competition in the ROK in the first half of 2025. Alumni Engagement: Participants who successfully complete the program will become YTL alumni and will be eligible to apply for future YTL-sponsored programs, which include other substantive opportunities to engage with trilateral youth and appear in public awareness campaigns. Participants may also be offered admission to other organization-specific alumni associations run by the implementing partner, but these activities should not form part of this grant. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E): Proposals must include a substantive monitoring and evaluation plan that sets clear goals and metrics to be tracked throughout the project. In addition, M&amp;E plans should include data collection (via focus groups, surveys, etc.) of participant populations to capture their feedback on the program and opinions on broader trilateral cooperation. Misc: &#8226; Proposals must include an American element or connection with U.S. experts, organizations, or institutions. Proposals may include requests for international travel and related costs of experts, speakers, and key individuals in support of broader activities. &#8226; Given the nature of trilateral programs, programs should be conducted in English &#8211; or if the target population lacks English fluency, must include interpretation. Programs whose exclusive goal is teaching English will not be considered.

In FY 2008, the SMART Office assumed management responsibility for this program as NSOPW is closely aligned with SMART&#8217;s mission, and jurisdiction participation (including states, the District of Columbia, principal U.S. territories and certain federally recognized Indian Tribes) is required by SORNA. Since 2008, Congress has specifically appropriated funds for NSOPW. At present, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, the territories of American Samoa, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands and 151 Tribes participate in NSOPW. NSOPW operates similarly to a search engine and uses web services to access registered sex offender information directly from individual jurisdictions. NSOPW links to state, territory, the District of Columbia, and Tribal public sex offender registries and allows users to conduct nationwide searches for registered sex offenders with one query rather than searching jurisdiction by jurisdiction. Since its inception, NSOPW has been heavily queried by the public and has had over 735 million searches and over 2 billion page views. In 2016, the SMART Office launched the NSOPW mobile application, allowing users to search from any mobile device. Available on Android and iOS, users have used the application to conduct over 11 million searches. In addition to the maintenance and support of NSOPW, this award supports the maintenance and enhancement of the SORNA Exchange Portal, a secure information-sharing system for jurisdictions as required under SORNA. This internet-based system provides a venue to streamline communication and coordination among jurisdictions&#8217; sex offender registry officials, as well as federal agencies. The cooperative agreement also supports the Tribe and Territory Sex Offender Registry System (TTSORS) and the Sex Offender Registry Tool (SORT). TTSORS is a web-based sex offender registry system that is free of charge to U.S territories and Indian Tribes that have elected to implement SORNA. TTSORS functions as both the administrative registry system and the public sex offender registry website for jurisdictions, which allows for participation in NSOPW. TTSORS also streamlines data sharing for Tribes participating in DOJ&#8217;s Tribal Access Program (TAP) by automatically sending registry information to the FBI&#8217;s National Sex Offender Registry (NSOR) and ensuring data synchronization between TTSORS and NSOR. In partnership with TAP, this cooperative agreement supports the development and enhancement of the TTSORS-NSOR interconnection tool, enabling over 100 Tribal sex offender registry databases to directly connect to NSOR and significantly increasing the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of Tribal data shared with law enforcement nationwide. SORT is a similar tool that may be used by registration agencies in states, U.S. territories and the District of Columbia, and provides a free customizable administrative registry system and public sex offender registry website. It is designed to enhance information-sharing capabilities and maximize efficiency and cost effectiveness of registry system setup and ongoing maintenance. The award also supports training for each of the technology tools and related resource development for jurisdictions, as well as the monitoring, maintenance, and updating of the NSOPW mobile applications for Android and iOS and NSOPW&#8217;s social media page.

Since its inception in 2011, AEIF has funded nearly 500 alumni-led projects around the world through a competitive global competition. AEIF is designed to help U.S. government exchange alumni develop and implement projects that support U.S. foreign policy objectives, promote shared interests, and benefit local communities. All AEIF projects must 1) convene alumni from different exchange programs to build or expand an alumni network capable of working together on common interests and increase regional and global collaboration of alumni, 2) strengthen the relationship between alumni and the U.S. government to work together on activities that address mutual goals and challenges, and/or 3) support alumni as they develop their leadership capacity and implement projects in their communities. This year, pending availability of funding, AEIF 2025 will accept public service projects proposed and managed by teams of at least two (2) alumni. Proposals must address at least one of the below-mentioned themes and demonstrate a commitment to Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) principles. They should illustrate how the project will support and advance equity with respect to religion, income, geography, gender identity, sexual orientation, and/or disability. Proposals that do not address the theme as outlined in the program objectives will be deemed ineligible. All project activities must take place outside of the United States and its territories. This cycle, the Public Diplomacy Section welcomes proposals in the following themes: Education Partnerships Proposals in this area may focus strengthening links between U.S. and Mozambican education institutions at the secondary and tertiary level. Examples include joint research projects that pair Mozambican and U.S. students and academics to address shared topics of concern, such as climate change, trades fields, migration, economic growth, history, culture, food security, inclusion, accessibility, STEM, and tech access. Vocational and technical training is also welcome. English Language Learning Proposals in this area may focus on one or more of the following: expanding access to English language education through teacher training programs, direct teaching of English language to targeted groups, curriculum development, expanding language learning resources, professional development, linking English language learning with career development, and improving Mozambican&#8217;s English level for prerequisite testing for admission to U.S. institutions of higher learning. Social Impact Entrepreneurship Proposals in this area develop entrepreneurship ecosystems, by supporting social impact entrepreneurship endeavors that address environmental, educational banking, agricultural, health and accessibility, technological, and infrastructure challenges with for-profit businesses solutions. Proposals may support capacity-building for aspiring entrepreneurs, certifications, and access to seed funding enterprises with a significant social impact. Special emphasis will be given to proposals that are inclusive and demonstrate scalability after the proposal period is complete. Strengthening Media Ecosystem Proposals in this area should enhance press freedoms and improve the capacity of journalists (senior and aspiring), to improve reporting standards, the quantity and quality of investigative reports, and increase media literacy for the public. This includes focusing on countering dis/mis information, as well as media access for underserved areas of Mozambique and underserved populations, including people with disabilities and those who only speak vernacular languages. Initiatives may focus on promoting collaboration between Mozambican and U.S. media organizations that deliver key improvements in countering disinformation, establishing ethical journalism standards, improving journalist safety, and increasing the sustainability of independent media outlets.",23.18,2025-01-14T16:44:19.4730000,2025-01-14T16:44:19.4730000,

Grants can launch new farm to school programs or expand existing efforts. The objective of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2025 Farm to School Turnkey grants is to simplify the proposal-writing process by providing pre-designed activities to simplify applications for frequently proposed farm to school projects. However, it is important for all prospective applicants to read the RFA in full to ensure that they understand all submission requirements. There are three Turnkey Grant project tracks available in FY 2025: Action Planning, Agricultural Education, and Edible Gardens. Applicants may only apply to one project track. The project types are summarized as follows: Turnkey &#8211; Action Planning grantees will develop a roadmap for launching or enhancing farm to school activities. Turnkey &#8211; Agricultural Education grantees will incorporate agricultural education into curricula. Turnkey &#8211; Edible Gardens grantees will implement a food production operation. All applicants must demonstrate a commitment to one or more federal Child Nutrition Program(s). The FY 2025 Farm to School Turnkey Grant awards projects of 24 months in length for funding up to $50,000. Applicants are required to provide matching support of at least 25 percent of the total project budget in the form of cash or in-kind contributions. Eligible applicants for the Turnkey Grant may include schools and other institutions that operate Child Nutrition Programs, Indian Tribal Organizations, agricultural producers or groups of agricultural producers, non-profit entities, and local agencies. This RFA is one of three funding opportunities being offered under the Patrick Leahy Farm to School Grant Program in FY 2025.

Studies may be either hypothesis-generating (unbiased discovery) or hypothesis-testing in design and may utilize in vivo, in situ, or in vitro experimental paradigms, e.g., model organisms or human cell-based assays. While behavioral paradigms and outcome measures can be incorporated into the research design to facilitate the characterization of intracellular, transcellular and circuit mechanisms, these are neither required nor expected. Studies should not attempt to model disorders but instead should aim to elucidate the neurobiological impact of individual or combined risk factor(s), such as the affected molecular and cellular components and their relationships within defined biological process(es).

The goal of SAEGs is to build foreign higher education institutions&#8217; capacity to develop partnerships with U.S counterparts. and host more U.S study abroad students. SAEGs can support the development of wider higher education partnerships and exchanges, but all projects must have activities directly linked to increasing foreign higher education institutions&#8217; capacity to host U.S. study abroad students. SAEGs are the foreign-focused component of USA Study Abroad&#8217;s higher education capacity-building programming. It is complemented by the Increase and Diversify Education Abroad for U.S. Students (IDEAS) Program, which provides grants and trainings to build U.S. colleges and universities&#8217; capacity to engage in international exchanges, including through the development of international partnerships. Through its work with SAEGs and the IDEAS Program, USA Study Abroad aims to build global higher education capacity to support U.S. study abroad programming, thereby increasing and diversifying the institutions, students, and destinations engaged in education abroad programming. The program is designed to encourage posts to think creatively about strategic support of international academic partnerships and U.S. students studying abroad in the following areas: &#183; Capacity-building or academic partnerships trainings: Post may propose webinars, workshops, expert seminars, or other in-person, hybrid, or virtual training activities for local and/or U.S. higher education administrators designed to improve their capacity to develop academic partnerships and exchange programming between local and U.S. higher education institutions. &#183; Partnership and study abroad program development: If post is working directly with U.S. and/or foreign higher education institution(s) interested in developing partnerships and programming, post may propose site visits, collaborative program design, faculty training, and other group activities to support the development of international partnerships and programming.

The ORLP Program is a competitive grant initiative under the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Act, aimed at enhancing parks, recreational opportunities, and conservation areas in urban, underserved communities. It complements the LWCF Stateside and Local Assistance Program formula grants to address the needs of these areas.The LWCF State and Local Assistance Program works with designated state, commonwealth, and territory agencies to provide grants to subrecipients: community organizations, local governments, federally recognized Tribes, Alaska Native Corporations (ANC), Alaska Native Organizations (ANO), and the Native Hawaiian Communities. These grants fund the acquisition and development of parks and outdoor recreation areas, as well as the renovation of existing facilities. Since ORLP projects are funded by LWCF they follow the same requirements to receive an award.To qualify for LWCF funds, each state must maintain an approved Statewide Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan (SCORP), which evaluates the supply and demand for outdoor recreation resources and sets funding priorities. Since ORLP projects are funded by LWCF, they must also align with their state&#8217;s SCORP. Funding for the ORLP Program does not impact a state or territory&#8217;s LWCF State and Local Assistance Program formula grant apportionment.As per the LWCF Act, a 1:1 or 50% minimum non-Federal share is required for ORLP award eligibility. Funds or in-kind contributions, such as land or services acquired with most other Federal funds, are not eligible for matching. Exceptions exist, however, for funds authorized by their enabling legislation to be treated as non-federal match. Common options include HUD&#8217;s Community Development Block Grants and Federal Highway Administration&#8217;s Recreation Trails Program.",17.65,2025-01-14T16:44:21.0600000,2025-01-14T16:44:21.0600000,

OVERVIEWThe United States Agency for International Development in Tajikistan (USAID/TJ) is collecting information on organizations with expertise in Tajikistan regarding risk communications and community engagement (RCCE) in global health security (GHS). This RFI seeks information on the availability, interest, and diverse capacities of entities to support a prospective USAID Tajikistan GHS Activity in Tajikistan.Note: This is NOT a request for applications. Only expressions of interest should be submitted atthis stage. USAID will use responses to inform decisions about future partnerships under thisactivity.This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and is NOT a Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO). It does not obligate the US Government to issue an award or pay for any information submitted. If a NOFO is issued, necessary details will be provided in that document.Interested parties are advised to periodically monitor the www.grants.gov and www.sam.gov websites for updates concerning potential procurement.Additionally, USAID plans to host online informational sessions in Russian, Tajik and English.Please email skholov@usaid.gov to RSVP for these sessions.The English version of this RFI shall control in case of any inconsistencies with translated versions.II. BACKGROUNDUSAID Tajikistan&#8217;s Global Health Security (GHS) program aims to fill essential gaps in health security in Tajikistan by integrating human, animal, and environmental health through the &quot;One Health&quot; approach. USAID&#8217;s GHS programming in Tajikistan aligns with the wider United States Government&#8217;s 2024 Global Health Security Strategy, to build strong and resilient health systems. GHS means protecting people everywhere from health threats that can spread across borders. It requires working together as a global community to prevent, detect, and respond to health emergencies. GHS is about keeping everyone safe and healthy, no matter where they live.USAID&#8217;s GHS program implements activities in 100 countries, and collaborates with different ministries and agencies as well as multisectoral partners to strengthen preparedness, prevent outbreaks, detect threats early, and respond effectively to infectious diseases. USAID supports countries in achieving measurable improvements in health security, guided by the World Health Organization&apos;s Joint External Evaluation (JEE) and State Parties Self-Assessment Annual Report (SPAR). This includes enhancing capabilities in areas such as zoonotic disease management, disease surveillance, laboratory systems, infection prevention, and antimicrobial resistance. In Tajikistan, the 2019 JEE assessment highlighted potential weaknesses in surveillance, laboratory capacity, infection control, and risk communication and community engagement (RCCE).USAID Tajikistan envisions to support implementation of GHS activities focusing on RCCE.The goal is to strengthen public health communication networks and ensure communities are better informed and equipped to deal with health risks.Key areas of focus may include:1. Developing community-centered risk communication strategies.2. Strengthening networks for effective engagement during public health crises.3. Engaging and collaborating with religious leaders on health promotion and advocacy4. Supporting health and emergency communication infrastructure.5. Building local capacity for health risk awareness and management.III.

The goal of the Service&#8217;s African Great Ape Conservation Fund (GACF-Africa) is to ensure the long-term conservation of African great apes in the wild. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species lists all African great apes as either Endangered or Critically Endangered, and all subspecies, with the exception of mountain gorillas (G. b. beringei), are experiencing decreasing population trends. Infectious disease is among the leading threats to most African great ape populations. Over the past few decades veterinary support for great ape health at the site level has increased substantially in some regions, but opportunities for Central African nationals to obtain the skills necessary to effectively address great ape and other wildlife health challenges remain limited, threatening the security of human, wildlife and ecosystem health. The Service seeks to strengthen capacity within Central African ape range states to effectively address great ape and broader wildlife health security issues. This funding opportunity seeks proposals for a targeted three-year Mentoring for Environmental Training in Outreach and Resource conservation (MENTOR) Program to improve the capacities of Central African veterinarians and veterinary colleges to achieve those aims. The objectives of the program are to 1) strengthen the capacity of wildlife veterinary practitioners in Central Africa to address health threats to great apes in the wild, 2) strengthen the capacity of academic institutions in Central Africa to address wildlife and great ape health threats, and 3) strengthen and sustain the great ape health community through a professional network. This increased capacity will also bring needed wildlife health and veterinary expertise to address health security in the region, supporting joint priorities for human and animal health. Understanding and addressing disease dynamics between humans and wildlife contributes to our collective ability to address future pandemics, safeguarding the American public. The successful applicant is expected to engage in a co-design process with the Service to implement the MENTOR program.

Studies which used nationwide administrative and claims data to estimate epilepsy incidence among children were conducted more than a decade ago and failed to provide national generalizability due to their limited data sources. This NOFO will contribute to a comprehensive understanding of epilepsy incidence (any type), incident-related risk factors, and incidence disparities among the general U.S. pediatric population or subpopulations. The knowledge obtained from this study will assist health officials shape public health policies by allocating resources, planning for healthcare services, and implementing preventive measures. The objectives of the NOFO are to: (1) Estimate epilepsy incidence among U.S. children 0 - 17 years of age based upon a study with comprehensive nationwide dataset(s), or a population-based study at a specific level(s) (e.g., national, regional, jurisdictional); (2) Identify factors that contribute to the risk of developing epilepsy, and examine the association between these risk factors and incidence; and (3) Examine potential disparities in incidence rates of epilepsy stratified by demographic, geographical, the social determinants of health (SDOH), or other characteristics. The target population is for U.S. children aged 0 - 17 years, and for the study of certain epilepsies, some age ranges within 0 - 17 years are acceptable. Additionally, this study should include a nationally representative sample of age, sex, race/ethnicity, and social strata, and include subgroups which allow an examination of risk factors and SDOH. The applicant is expected to: (1) Conduct a retrospective study using public/commercial administrative and/or claims data, electronic health records, or survey data; (2) Ensure dataset(s) have sufficient sample sizes relative to risk factors, allowing incidence rates to be stratified by these factors. If public/commercial claims data or survey data are used, it should include child populations from all states and Washington DC. Examples of claims data are Marketscan and Medicaid. If EHR data are used, adequate details/justification must be included; (3) Identify risk factors based on the literature. Risk factors may be children-specific (e.g., prenatal, perinatal, or neonatal factors), children non-specific (e.g., comorbidities, demographic, SDOH factors), and/or other factors; and (4) Propose a research team with expertise in epidemiological methods, analytical skills, and pediatric epilepsy diagnosis and treatment.",6.72,2025-01-14T16:44:18.8130000,2025-01-14T16:44:18.8130000,

In this case &quot;omnibus&quot; means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates (Tables 2 and 3), a table that provides a very top level summary of proposal contents (Table 1), and the full text of the ROSES-2024 &quot;Summary of Solicitation&quot;, may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024.

On that page, on the right side under &quot;Announcement Documents&quot; the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH24ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on &#8220;C.8 Lunar Data Analysis Program (.pdf)&#8221; to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read &#8220;C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.pdf)&#8221; from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs. Questions concerning general ROSES-2024 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov, but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list.

The Defense Innovation Unit is focused on strengthening the national security innovation base by lowering the barriers to entry for talent and non-traditional companies to work with DoD. The Defense Innovation OnRamp is a core part of DIU&#8217;s strategy to develop a robust regional presence in order to tap into the extant commercial technology ecosystems and innovation base. This strategy includes distributed DIU offices, a regional team, OnRamp Hubs, and other relationships with the academic, startup and commercial sectors. At present, DIU operates out of 5 regional offices, has approximately 30 regionally focused representatives, and partners with over 100 universities. In the last year, DIU, with extensive support from Congress, established five OnRamp Hubs in Phoenix, Arizona; Dayton, Ohio; Honolulu, Hawaii; Seattle, Washington, and Wichita, Kansas. The recipient(s) will design, develop and manage a network of offices, physical and digital hubs, and other collaborative partnerships and projects designed to lower the barriers for entry for commercial and dual-use technology into the DoD. This will involve collaboration between a diverse set of stakeholders including private industry, private capital, research organizations, government stakeholders, academia, regional economic development organizations, DoD mission partners, other government entities, and others, with the intent of sourcing, developing, and executing viable solutions that lower entry barriers while attracting and helping scale new commercial technology and talent into the national security innovation base. The recipient(s) sought for this NFO will provide direction to improve the ways in which non-traditional companies and talent can work with the Department of Defense and grow regional defense innovation ecosystems, and oversee the execution. These efforts should be aligned with the types of commercial and dual-use technology that DIU is bringing into the Department with the speed and scale required for strategic effect. DIU will expect recipient(s) of this award to provide infrastructure for the Defense Innovation OnRamp. This could include areas such as coordination, knowledge sharing, resource management, ensuring standardization of tools and governance, and conducting regular performance management for work through this effort.

The Nursing Home Staffing Campaign (NHSC) is aimed at increasing the availability of nurses to work in the nursing home environment, such as in qualifying nursing homes or in an oversight capacity for a state inspection agency.This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is focused on helping to recruit Registered Nurses (RNs) to work in nursing homes by offering financial incentives. Through this NOFO, CMS is accepting applications for cooperative agreements to entities who will administer financial incentives, such as tuition reimbursement and stipends, to RNs to work for three years in a qualifying nursing home or in an oversight role with a state agency",15.39,2025-01-14T16:44:21.2700000,2025-01-14T16:44:21.2700000,

Firms with the capability to conduct research and development (R&amp;D) in any of the research topic areas listed in Section 9.0 of this announcement and to commercialize the results of that R&amp;D are encouraged to participate. The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program is not a substitute for existing unsolicited proposal mechanisms. Unsolicited proposals are not accepted under the SBIR program.Only FY 2025 Phase I applications may be submitted in response to this NOFO. Phase II applications are not being accepted at this time. NOAA will publish a Phase II NOFO approximately 30 days prior to the end of the previous year&#8217;s Phase I period of performance to request Phase II applications. That NOFO will provide instructions for Phase I awardees to prepare a Phase II application and the closing date for submission of applications; only the previous year&#8217;s Phase I awardees are eligible to submit a Phase II application.The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program was originally established in 1982 by the Small Business Innovation Development Act (P.L. 97-219), codified at 15 U.S.C. &#167; 638. It was then expanded and extended by the Small Business Research and Development Enhancement Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-564), and received subsequent reauthorization and extensions, the most recent of which extends the SBIR program through 2025. (P.L. 117-183).Each Federal agency with an extramural budget for Research/Research and Development (R/R&amp;D) in excess of $100,000,000 must participate in the SBIR program and spend (obligate) a minimum percentage of their extramural R/R&amp;D budgets (obligations) of not less than 3.2% of such budget in fiscal year 2017 and for the percentage required by statute for each fiscal year after for awards to small business concerns (SBCs) for R/R&amp;D under the SBIR program. The objectives of the SBIR program are to: stimulate technological innovation in the private sector; strengthen the role of small business in meeting Federal R&amp;D needs; foster and encourage participation by businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged persons and women-owned SBCs in technological innovation; and increase private sector commercialization of innovations derived from federal R&amp;D funding.Fostering diversity by encouraging the participation of individuals from nationally underrepresented groups in the scientific research workforce is longstanding interest of Congress, and a key component of NOAA&#8217;s commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (e.g., Public Law 114-329, American Innovation and Competitiveness Act of 2017, and https://techpartnerships.noaa.gov/abouttpo/dei-statement/). Increasing participation by socially and economically disadvantaged and women-owned small businesses is critical to the success of the SBIR program.",16.52,2025-01-14T16:44:19.6630000,2025-01-14T16:44:19.6630000,

These residency programs must achieve accreditation from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). Newly created rural residency programs will increase the number of future physicians training in rural areas, and ultimately the number of physicians practicing in rural areas with the goal of addressing the physician workforce shortages in rural communities. The RRPD program provides start-up funding to create new rural residency programs in qualifying medical specialties that will be sustainable long-term through viable and stable funding mechanisms, such as Medicare, Medicaid, and other public or private funding sources. Qualifying medical specialties are family medicine, internal medicine, preventive medicine, psychiatry, general surgery, and obstetrics and gynecology. For this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO), rural residency programs: &#8226;Are accredited physician residency programs. &#8226;Train residents in clinical training sites that are physically located in a rural area as defined by HRSA&#8217;s Federal Office of Rural Health Policy (FORHP) [1] for greater than 50 percent of their total time in residency. &#8226;Focus on producing physicians who will practice in rural communities. The purpose of the RRPD Program is to fund the development of new rural residency programs in qualifying medical specialties. For this funding opportunity, we consider &#8220;new&#8221; programs to include both programs seeking accreditation for the first time and existing programs that apply for a permanent complement increase to train additional residents at new rural training site(s) as part of an RTP. To be responsive to the program purpose and be considered for funding, you must propose a new rural residency program in a qualifying medical specialty. For this funding opportunity, we do not consider the following to be new programs: &#8226;Programs that have received accreditation or a permanent complement increase for their proposed rural residency program before the application due date. &#8226;Programs seeking to increase resident full-time equivalents at an existing RTP site without adding a new rural training site.",16.49,2025-01-14T16:44:18.8130000,2025-01-14T16:44:18.8130000,

Background Djibouti&apos;s education system faces challenges, particularly at the middle school level. While enrollment rates have increased, many students struggle to acquire the essential skills needed for success in secondary education and future careers. Retention rates are low, with a significant drop-off observed in grades six and seven. Additionally, students often lack the soft skills critical for navigating the complexities of modern life. This disparity is further exacerbated by factors like poverty, limited access to quality education, and social norms that disproportionately affect girls and marginalized populations. Key Challenges: &#9679; Low retention rates: Almost 10% of students who have access to middle school wouldn&apos;t reach the final year. &#9679; Inadequate foundational skills: A significant portion of students who pass the Grade 5 exam lack the necessary skills for success in middle school. &#9679; Limited soft skills development: Current curriculum doesn&apos;t adequately prepare students with essential 21st-century skills. &#967...",13.22,2025-01-14T16:44:19.4670000,2025-01-14T16:44:19.4670000,

Cyberspace has evolved from an interconnected digital environment into a complex and interdependent cyber ecosystem that involves hardware, software, networks, data, people, organizations, countries, and the physical world. Critical functions of everyday life are deeply intertwined with computing, including health, government, commerce, the public sphere, education, critical infrastructure, interpersonal communication, and transportation. The complexity and inter-dependencies in cyberspace can be misused and exploited by malicious actors. These in turn can trigger adverse outcomes such as disruption of critical infrastructure and systems; theft of intellectual property and sensitive data; amplification of inequalities; disclosure of private information of individuals, organizations, and governments; and threats to lives, livelihoods, and reputations. Furthermore, constant attacks on the data and assets of corporations, governments, and individuals undermine people&#8217;s trust in decision-making and processes that depend critically on these cyber systems. The Security, Privacy, and Trust in Cyberspace (SaTC 2.0) program aims to build trust in global cyber ecosystems. Trust is the core tenet of this program and, for the purposes of this solicitation, is broadly defined to include our confidence in the security, privacy, and resilience of cyberspace, particularly in the face of malicious intent. Achieving this level of confidence in cyberspace requires not only understanding the vulnerabilities in a system that could be exploited and how they can be addressed, but also understanding the social and technical dimensions of trust in cyber systems, along with the educational efforts needed to increase public awareness of risks in cyberspace, and building a well-trained corps of privacy and security professionals. SaTC 2.0 spans the interests of NSF&apos;s Directorates for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS), Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE), and STEM Education (EDU). Proposals must be submitted pursuant to one of the following designations, each of which may have additional requirements: RES: The Research (RES) designation is the focus of the multidisciplinary SaTC 2.0 research program. RES projects are limited to $1,200,000 in total budget, with durations of up to four years. Proposals with a total budget of more than $600,000 have additional requirements including Broadening Participation in Computing and collaboration plans. RES proposals may include an optional Transition to Education (TTE) plan with a budget up to $50,000 (within the RES total budget request) to co-evolve novel educational initiatives in the context of the proposed research. EDU: The Education (EDU) designation is used to identify proposals focusing on education and workforce training in building trust in security, privacy, and resilience of cyberspace. EDU proposals are limited to $500,000 in total budget, with durations of up to three years. EDU proposals that primarily focus on education research with demonstrated collaboration, as reflected in the PI team between cybersecurity subject matter experts and education researcher(s), may request an additional $100,000 beyond the $500,000 limit.

Submitting an application to CMS to change the EHB in the state. We understand that, due in part to these challenges, that there are many states that have not considered updating their EHB-benchmark plans. These states include 24 of the 28 states expected to have a Federally-facilitated Exchange (FFE) as of January 1, 2026. As a result, the covered benefits in the Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) offered through the Exchanges in these states may not reflect recent changes in medical evidence, scientific advancement, and clinical care guidelines. Additionally, people enrolled in these QHPs may have trouble accessing EHB because of cost, claims denials, utilization management, discriminatory benefit design, or other factors.

Yet, the development of biomedical products is often impeded by a significant funding gap between the end of the SBIR Phase II award and the commercialization stage. This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) invites SBIR grant applications from SBCs to support later-stage research and development (referred to as Phase IIB) for promising projects that were previously funded by SBIR or STTR Phase II awards and will require eventual Federal regulatory approval/clearance. The goal of this NOFO and the resulting Phase IIB awards is to assist applicants in pursuing the milestone(s) necessary to advance a product to regulatory approval and commercialization by promoting partnerships between SBIR Phase II awardees and third-party investors and/or strategic partners. Projects proposed under this NOFO MUST be relevant to the NHLBI mission (see B. Scientific/Technical Scope). This NOFO is specifically intended to benefit clinical practice by accelerating the commercialization of novel products that require ultimate approval/clearance by a Federal regulatory agency.

This funding opportunity seeks to improve the quality of HIV care in Zambia by soliciting and triangulating recipient of care feedback collected by trained community members. PEPFAR Zambia and Government Republic of Zambia (GRZ) Ministry of Health uses this information to strengthen, address gaps and improve the outcomes of HIV services. PEPFAR Zambia seeks not-for-profit organizations with the capacity to collaborate with PEPFAR, key stakeholders, as well as community level recipients of care of PEPFAR supported services. Potential grantees should build on past work, be able to implement a monitoring program to promote cooperation in improving HIV care, encourage all People living with HIV (PLHIV) constituencies, including but not limited to key populations (KP), adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) persons with disability and pregnant and breastfeeding women (PBFW), to share their experience and facilitate discussion and insight that makes a difference in the HIV response. Program Objectives PEPFAR Zambia recognizes the importance of engaging with communities in the development and implementation of its HIV programming. The CLM program started in 2021 with PEPFAR providing funding and technical support to not-for-profit organizations implementing in each province. Beginning May 2025, PEPFAR will support CLM implementation with organizations aiming to strengthen previous CLM activities and systematically address client feedback. In partnership with the National HIV/AIDS, STI, and TB Council (NAC) and the Ministry of Health (MOH), quarterly review meetings of recipient of care and client feedback will be held to identify persistent and common problems, challenges, and barriers to service uptake at the site and facility level. To facilitate and ensure all provinces and PLHIV constituencies are represented, PEPFAR Zambia seeks applicants from community organizations from each province in Zambia. The grantees are encouraged to integrate PLHIV-focused community organizations within their province as structures that will facilitate recipient of care engagement for feedback collection. The feedback will be collected and reported using a harmonized reporting tool created by stakeholders. The role of the grantees will focus on feedback collection and synthesizing feedback to share with stakeholders with approval from PEPFAR and MOH, while PEPFAR Zambia will provide oversight of CLM implementation. The grantees are expected to collect recipient of care feedback and experience in two phases; phases one establishes a baseline while phase two demonstrates changes in quality-of-service provision. The deliverables are: 1. Include low and high-volume health facilities offering PEPFAR supported HIV related services across the province, as part of data collection. 2. Collect feedback from all PLHIV constituencies, including but not limited to KP, AGYW, persons with disability, and PBFW. Applications which do not include plans for the inclusion of all constituencies will not be considered. 3. Submit monthly programmatic reporting. 4. Submit quarterly summarized programmatic indicators and financial reporting 5. Track changes in recipient of care feedback and service provision between phase one and two feedback collection. 6. Participate in quarterly meetings with government, community, United States Government (USG) and implementing partners. 7. Make actionable recommendations to improve client care based on feedback from recipients of care.

The intent of the Community Wood is to support forest health and stimulate local economies by expanding renewable wood energy use and innovative wood products manufacturing capacity. The Forest Service solicits proposals for projects that will achieve the following: Expand thermally led community wood energy or innovative wood product opportunities; Improve Forest health; and Stimulate local economies. This funding opportunity is intended for shovel ready projects that will not require additional funding or time to complete after the award period. Examples of eligible projects include, but are not limited to: Install a thermally led community wood energy system for heating, cooling, and/or electricity that replaces fossil fuels such as coal, oil, propane, or natural gas. Purchase and install manufacturing equipment at a mass timber production facility. Expand a sawmill to add higher value production lines that incorporate innovative technologies and cost cutting measures. Purchase and install equipment at a new facility to produce biofuels from forest residues. All awards are based on funding availability. The Forest Service plans to award up to $6 million in total awards under this announcement. The maximum for each award is $1 million to pay for up to 35% of total capital costs. The Forest Service may consider awarding up to $1.5 million (for up to 50% of total capital costs) for a proposal that warrants special consideration, especially for projects located in areas of high unemployment. Matching funds are not required; however, leveraging is required. Applicants must contribute the remaining funds (leveraged funds) necessary to complete the project above and beyond the requested Forest Service funding. For example, if an applicant requests Forest Service funding for 35% of the total capital costs of the project, then the applicant must commit to providing 65% of the total capital costs of the project. In this example, the 65% of the total capital costs are considered the required leveraged funds. Even though leveraged funds have a lower reporting burden and fewer legal requirements than matching funds, applicants must adhere to requirements for leveraged funds. Leveraged funds must be from non-federal sources and be committed within the grant timeframe. Moreover, if third-party organizations contribute to the leveraged funds requirement, then applicants must submit with their proposal package commitment letters from the third-party organizations confirming the amount of leveraging being committed.

The mission of JAMS is to maintain a warfighting advantage, by identifying, evaluating, and rapidly deploying innovative solutions for U.S. aircraft in emergent operational Areas of Responsibility (AORs), seizing upon opportunities that will benefit the services across the DoD. There is a strong desire within the ASE community to share costs and provide common solutions across platforms as much as possible.While most are familiar with red kill chains, there is a corollary for blue ASE protection. The JAMS IPT is broadly looking for technologies in the ASE protection chain, including:Threat Detection: Sensing and identifying a threat;Fix: Geo-location and threat avoidance;Signature: Tactics and procedures to reduce signatures but also equipment that can modify or alter an aircraft&#8217;s signature;Defeat: This includes traditional jammers, expendables, towed decoys but also new solutions launched from the aircraft or escort aircraft to degrade, seduce or confuse a threat; andAssess: The ability to evaluate the effects of avoidance, signature management or defeat.However, beyond these protection capabilities, are enabling tools required for developing, testing and fielding solutions, particularly in Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S), and Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) activities.This announcement seeks revolutionary ideas and technology demonstrators that offer potential material solutions, M&amp;S solutions, and T&amp;E solutions at a TRL 3 or higher with a robust plan to achieve TRL 6. Solutions with an open architecture will be favored. A classified secret addendum with examples of stressing adversarial technologies can be requested on SIPRNET at betsy.l.marschand1@navy.smil.mil.

GNA can be an effective tool to partner with a cooperating entity that is carrying out weed treatments, whether using herbicide, mechanical, or biological controls, in a coordinated cross boundary effort.Fuels Management &#8211; Mechanical treatments (e.g. thinning, piling, mastication, mowing) chemical and biological applications, and prescribed fire to protect communities at risk, improve wildfire resiliency, and provide a safe and effective wildfire response.Community Assistance &#8211; Projects across ownership boundaries with mutual benefit and the ability to leverage funds to complete work on the ground. Some treatments could include thinning around a community at risk, juniper removal to improve landscape resiliency.Forest Management &#8211; Conduct treatments to enhance resilience of forests to wildfire, insect, disease, and drought through density management.Rangeland plant restoration &#8211; Whether impacts are from wildfire, drought, or noxious weeds and invasive species, it is often necessary to aid the re-establishment of rangeland vegetation. This could entail development of plant materials, seed collection, site preparation, and seed or seedling planting. Native plant restoration is also often a cross boundary need and where a cooperating entity is conducting these activities, GNA can be used to conduct these activities on BLM managed lands.Wildlife movement, migration, and habitat connectivity &#8211; GNA can be used to facilitate cross-boundary cooperative habitat restoration and rangeland structural improvements to improve habitat connectivity and support unimpeded movement of wildlife populations across landscapes. Examples of cooperative habitat connectivity projects may include: cross-boundary work associated with fence removals or upgrades to reduce animal fatalities and movement barriers; invasive species control and reseeding or planting of native vegetation along migration corridors and stopover areas; and enhancement of water resource availability within important wildlife movement areas (i.e., development and protection of natural springs, removal of invasive riparian species to increase water availability, construction of guzzlers and other artificial water sources, wet meadow restoration, etc.).NEPA &#8211; GNA stipulates that the BLM decision cannot be delegated to a cooperating entity. However, a cooperating entity can provide assistance in conducting NEPA for a restoration project when it is a part of the overall project to implement Authorized Restoration Services.Riparian restoration &#8211; Restoration work following flood events, large washouts, or changes to riparian area form and function that support wildlife and livestock is often more effective when implemented throughout a stream reach in coordination with a cooperating entity and other federal agencies. GNA can be used to install headcut and erosion control structures, check dam repair and removal, leaking ditches, re-contouring, or re-vegetation to support stream banks.Targeted grazing &#8211; Targeted grazing (prescribed grazing or managed herbivory) is the carefully controlled grazing by livestock to accomplish specific vegetation management objectives. Livestock may be used as a means to improve land health through weed control, wildfire fuels reduction, and other restoration activities. Activities that are often needed to implement targeted grazing include installation of fence, installation of range improvements including enclosures, maintenance of improvements, and livestock and range monitoring.",12.99,2025-01-14T16:44:21.0700000,2025-01-14T16:44:21.0700000,

The AWE program, established by the U.S. State Department&apos;s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA) in 2019, aims to provide women with the knowledge, networks, and access needed to launch or scale successful businesses. The program uses the no-cost, online DreamBuilder platform, developed in partnership with Arizona State University and Freeport-McMoRan. The DreamBuilder platform teaches participants the fundamentals of starting or growing a small business from a U.S. perspective, offering modules on marketing, pricing, and bookkeeping, and includes a built-in business plan generator. By promoting women&#8217;s economic opportunities and ensuring that women have the capabilities and resources to participate in the economy, the AWE program directly supports the U.S. National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality. The Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region (GBAO) and Khatlon regions of Tajikistan have significant potential for economic development, particularly through the empowerment of women entrepreneurs. Despite recent progress, women in these regions face numerous challenges, including limited access to financial resources, business training, and market opportunities. Cultural and social barriers also hinder women&#8217;s participation in the entrepreneurial ecosystem. These regions have been particularly associated with a large population of labor migrants. Approximately 30% of the working-age population in GBAO and 25% in Khatlon are engaged in labor migration, primarily to Russia and other neighboring countries. This migration trend significantly impacts the local economy and the availability of human resources, particularly affecting women who often remain behind to manage households and seek alternative income sources. Project Goal: Increase participation of women entrepreneurs in Tajikistan&#8217;s GBAO and Khatlon regions&#8217; local economy by offering a U.S.-style online education facilitated and localized by State Department exchange alumni and local partners. The project aims to foster networks for peer-to-peer mentorship, business partnerships, and scale opportunities with regional and U.S. businesses. Project Objectives: Project proposals may address one or more of the project themes listed below. Applicants are encouraged to incorporate all the objectives listed under a selected theme. Empower Women Entrepreneurs through Training and Skills Development Improve women entrepreneurs&#8217; confidence and motivation in pursuing and growing their businesses, as measured by 90% improvement in self-reported confidence levels by the end of the training. Increase the ability of women to create and grow their businesses, resulting in 50% of participants launching a registered business or scaling up their business within 6 months of completing the program. Promote the use of technology and digital tools among women entrepreneurs, resulting in at least 90% of participants actively using two or more digital tools in their businesses Digital tools include but are not limited to: e-commerce platforms, social media marketing, financial management software, and more). Enhance Awareness and Access to Business Opportunities and Funding Increase women entrepreneurs&#8217; awareness and knowledge of business opportunities in Tajikistan, resulting in at least 90% of participants applying for at least one business opportunity within three months of completing the training. Increase the capacity of 15-20 of women entrepreneurs to apply for funding opportunities, including grants, loans, and investments, resulting in at least 50% of participants applying for funding within six months of completing the training and 50% of participants receiving funding approval to fuel their business growth. Project Audience Women aged 18 to 45. Women from Khatlon or GBAO regions. Holding high school and/or university degrees. Approximately 1-2 years of business experience. Motivation to start or scale a long-term business or entrepreneurial activity. From diverse backgrounds in GBAO or Khatlon regions of Tajikistan. Minimum intermediate computer skills. Proven leadership experience. Ideally experience volunteering in local communities. Some English proficiency preferred, but not required.

Funding will be used for fish passage that rebuilds productive and sustainable fisheries, contributes to the recovery and conservation of threatened and endangered species, enhances watershed health, promotes resilient ecosystems and communities, especially in underserved communities, and improves economic vitality, including local employment. This funding opportunity announcement is authorized under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), Public Law 117-58). Applicants should address the following program priorities: 1. Achieving measurable and lasting benefits for migratory fish populations; 2. Enhancing community resilience to climate hazards and providing other co-benefits; 3. Fostering regionally important habitat restoration; and 4. Providing benefit to and engaging with underserved communities, including through partnerships with Indian tribes and other indigenous communities. Proposals submitted under this funding opportunity should describe how the proposed fish passage will: 1. Contribute to the recovery of threatened and endangered species listed under the Endangered Species Act; 2. Sustain or help rebuild fish stocks and their prey managed under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act; 3. Improve passage to support native fish species of the Great Lakes; 4. Enhance the sustainability of saltwater recreational fisheries; 5. Enhance community resilience, especially in tribal, indigenous and underserved communities, to climate hazards by removing or improving aging infrastructure and supporting other co- benefits; or 6. Support hydroelectric license surrender to remove dams that are no longer economically viable or provide significant public benefits. Proposed activities may include future project development and feasibility studies; engineering and design; permitting; on-the-ground fish passage restoration; pre- and post-removal implementation monitoring; community engagement, including in tribal, indigenous and underserved communities; building the capacity of new and existing restoration partners to manage multi-faceted project design and construction; and education and outreach. Applicants may apply for funding to support one or more of these activities. Priority will be given to activities with the highest certainty to occur within a 2-3 year award period. Proposals may include multiple locations throughout a watershed or other geographic area and should demonstrate how multiple locations collectively contribute to priorities within the watershed or geographic area. Proposals that focus on the removal of barriers will score higher than proposals that install structures that require operations and maintenance. NOAA is committed to the goals of advancing equity and support for underserved communities. NOAA encourages applicants to include and demonstrate principles of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility through proactive, meaningful, and equitable community engagement in the identification, design, and/or implementation of proposed projects. NOAA also encourages applicants to propose projects with benefits to tribal, indigenous or underserved communities and that appropriately consider and elevate local or indigenous knowledge in project design, implementation, and evaluation. Applicants should identify if the project is located within tribal or underserved communities and/or whether a portion of the resilience benefits from the proposed work will flow to tribal, indigenous or underserved communities. This program will advance the Biden-Harris Administration&#8217;s Justice40 Initiative. Established by Executive Order 14008 on Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad, the Justice40 Initiative set the goal that 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain federal investments, such as climate, clean energy, and other areas, flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized and overburdened by pollution and underinvestment. Proposals selected for funding through this funding opportunity will be funded through cooperative agreements. NOAA anticipates that the period of performance for most awards will be for three years. NOAA anticipates typical federal funding for awards will range from $3 million to $5 million over three years.

Street Medicine Overview As a client-centered service, street medicine is designed to bring the services offered in a clinic into the unsheltered spaces where people live, spend time, and congregate such as the streets and wooded areas. As described by subject matter experts globally, street medicine is conducted where people live and must include a change in traditional health care delivery structure to engage those unstably housed. Street medicine is not a new form of health care delivery. Rather, street medicine programs have existed for decades. These programs have demonstrated the ability to provide health care service in an effective manner, resulting in improved health outcomes. Street medicine programs may take a different approach to address components of delivering health care services than traditional health care settings. Some components are the safety, local and state regulations, and selection of services to offer people. Clinic-based and street medicine interventions have different approaches for assuring safety of the teams and clients because of the different environments and availability of resources in each setting. Local and state regulations may determine which health care services can be delivered in which setting and when. These components are important to understand and include in all street medicine programs. Health care delivered in traditional settings, such as a clinic or mobile unit, may not address the needs of those who experience rough sleeping or are unsheltered. Barriers such as facility hours of operation and policies related to entry (e.g., no pets, no carts, requirements for shirts and shoes) impact access to and retention in care. Stigma and discrimination may be other factors that prevent those with previous poor experiences in clinic-based settings who are unsheltered from entering traditional settings for health care. Because people who are rough sleepers or are unsheltered experience a combination of varied social determinants of health challenges, street medicine teams encounter populations with chronic disease co-morbidities, mental health and substance use disorders, and other structural factors requiring innovative approaches (see also Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)&#8217;s 2023-2026 Strategic Plan). Based on the 2022 RWHAP Services Report, 5.2% of clients served were unstably housed with another 6.9% temporarily housed. Clients who were unstably housed had a viral suppression of 72.4% and people who were temporarily housed had a viral suppression of 84.1%, which is lower viral suppression than those who have stable housing. To end the HIV epidemic in the United States, strategies that tailor services to meet the needs of people who are not engaged in care or virally suppressed where they are located are required. Street medicine, as a form of health care delivery, can be an effective intervention to help RWHAP clients who are not well served by traditional health care delivery systems. Therefore, while street medicine focuses on those people who are unstably housed, it can also serve those who are averse to a traditional clinic building environment.",14.22,2025-01-14T16:44:18.8100000,2025-01-14T16:44:18.8100000,

NOAA anticipates up to $20 million will be available under this opportunity, of which up to 15% will specifically be available as direct awards and subawards to Indian tribes (as defined in 25 U.S.C. Section 5304 (e)) and Native American organizations that represent Indian tribes through formal legal agreements (e.g. tribal commissions, tribal consortia, tribal conservation districts, and tribal cooperatives). The remaining funding will be available to all eligible applicants. Funding will prioritize capacity building, meaningful engagement, and restoration project activities that enhance resilience of tribes, tribal entities, and underserved communities and have the greatest potential to lead to habitat restoration in coastal, estuarine, marine, and Great Lakes areas. This funding opportunity is authorized under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Bipartisan Infrastructure Law) (BIL, Public Law 117-58), 135 STAT. 1356 (Nov. 15, 2021). This funding opportunity does not have a formal matching requirement. Projects that are most responsive to the program priorities will be more competitive. Potential activities include: 1) capacity building, which may include (but is not limited to) participation in municipal or regional-scale resilience planning, project planning and feasibility studies, stakeholder engagement, proposal development for future funding, and outreach and education, as well as hiring of staff to increase capacity to support the planning, design and implementation of restoration actions, as well as capacity to support overall award management including tracking, reporting, and project coordination/development; 2) meaningful engagement, which may include (but is not limited to) engaging the community through educational opportunities, community discussions, and/or paid experiences that support the successful execution of the proposed project activities; 3) restoration project activities, including for demonstration projects, which may include engineering and design, permitting, on-the-ground restoration, and pre- and post project implementation monitoring. Competitive applications will directly benefit tribes or underserved communities. Applicants may apply for funding to support one or more of these activities. This funding opportunity supports NOAA&#8217;s efforts to enhance coastal resilience. Coastal areas support the nation&#8217;s largest and often fastest-growing population centers, as well as key natural assets. Strengthening coastal resilience means preparing and adapting coastal communities to mitigate the impacts of and more quickly recover after extreme events such as hurricanes, coastal storms, flooding, and sea level rise. Habitat restoration and natural and nature-based solutions are critical to doing so by: protecting lives and property; sustaining commercial, recreational, and subsistence fishing; recovering threatened and endangered species; and maintaining and fostering vibrant coastal economies and lifestyles. This funding opportunity &#8211; along with those for National Oceans and Coastal Security Fund Grants, Climate Resilience Regional Challenge Grants, Transformational Habitat Restoration and Coastal Resilience Grants, Coastal Zone Management, and National Estuarine Research Reserves &#8211; aims to fund projects that enhance coastal resilience. This funding opportunity in particular focuses on building organizational and technical capacity and/or supporting restoration activities that benefit tribes, tribal entities, and/or underserved communities and enhance their resilience to climate hazards. Through this funding opportunity, NOAA offers funding for tribes, tribal entities, and/or underserved community applicants to meaningfully engage their communities through outreach and education throughout the project. Meaningful engagement ensures community members are integral to the visioning, decision-making, and leadership for coastal habitat restoration projects that may affect their environment, and/or health and well-being. For applicants demonstrating a connection to tribes, tribal entities, and/or underserved communities, meaningful engagement of tribes, tribal entities, and/or underserved communities is intended to ensure that community members are integral to the visioning, decision-making, and leadership for coastal habitat restoration projects; to ensure that the scope of such projects are inclusive of the priorities and needs of communities; and/or to ensure that the benefits of such projects flow back to tribes, tribal entities, or underserved communities. NOAA is committed to the goals of advancing equity and support for underserved communities. NOAA encourages applicants to include and demonstrate principles of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility through proactive, meaningful, and equitable community engagement in the identification, design, and/or implementation of proposed projects. NOAA also encourages applicants to appropriately consider and elevate local or Indigenous knowledge in project design, implementation, and evaluation. Applicants should identify if the project is located within tribal or underserved communities and/or whether a portion of the resilience benefits from the proposed work will flow to tribes, tribal entities, or underserved communities. This program will advance the Biden/Harris Administration&#8217;s Justice40 Initiative. Established by Executive Order 14008 on Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad, the Justice40 Initiative set the goal that 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain federal investments, such as climate, clean energy, and other areas, flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized and overburdened by pollution and underinvestment. Proposals selected for funding through this opportunity will be funded through cooperative agreements. NOAA encourages a period of performance of up to three years, with the potential for up to five years, if necessary and approved by NOAA. NOAA anticipates typical federal funding for awards will range from $250,000 to $1 million over three years. NOAA will not accept proposals with a total federal funding request of less than $75,000 or more than $2 million for the entire award. Projects requesting the upper limit of funding are expected to implement restoration actions in addition to capacity-building and meaningful engagement, versus being solely focused on capacity-building and/or meaningful engagement activities. Priority will be given to activities with the highest certainty to occur within a 2-3 year award period. Funds will be administered by the NOAA Office of Habitat Conservation, as directed by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.",22.32,2025-01-14T16:44:21.0630000,2025-01-14T16:44:21.0630000,

In this case &quot;omnibus&quot; means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates (Tables 2 and 3), a table that provides a very top level summary of proposal contents (Table 1), and the full text of the ROSES-2024 &quot;Summary of Solicitation&quot;, may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024. This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements.

On that page, on the right side under &quot;Announcement Documents&quot; the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH24ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on &#8220;C.8 Lunar Data Analysis Program (.pdf)&#8221; to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read &#8220;C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.pdf)&#8221; from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs. Questions concerning general ROSES-2024 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov, but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list.

The Kremlin&#8217;s efforts to silence independent voices, restrict access to unbiased information, and punish dissent represent a pattern of systematic repression of the Russian people&#8217;s fundamental freedoms. The United States recognizes this and distinguishes between Russia&#8217;s government and its people. The United States respects the Russian people&#8217;s contributions to science, culture, and education. Maintaining and strengthening the people-to-people connections between our countries serves the long-term interests of the United States and remains the bedrock upon which a future, more constructive bilateral relationship could emerge. In that spirit, the United States supports people-to-people engagements, exchange programs, and other initiatives that allow Russian students, scholars, and civil society members to experience the United States, its culture, and its values firsthand, and that promote interaction between the Russian and American people with the aim of keeping the door open to a better future.

The two RRCIs will be to be known as the &#8220;Atlantic Reef Research Coordination Institute&apos;&apos; and the &#8220;Pacific Reef Research Coordination Institute&apos;&apos; and will hold this designation for an initial five (5) year period of performance and may be renewed for up to another five (5) years without competition. Applicants must be previously designated as a Coral Reef Research Center by the CRCP in 2024. The selected RRCIs must be able to work across a variety of areas including conducting research, supporting ecological research and monitoring, building capacity within jurisdictional resource management agencies, translating research findings to management and restoration practices, and conducting public education and awareness programs. Building capacity in the jurisdictions may include a variety of actions such as supporting personnel, providing training on jurisdictional driven topics, and/or managing a national fellowship program. NOAA CRCP anticipates that up to $4,500,000 may be available annually for distribution between the two RRCIs. The actual annual funding will be based on 1) CRCP annual appropriations, 2) current and future national and state priorities, 3) the quality of projects proposed and selected during the negotiations, and 4) the satisfactory progress in achieving the stated goals described in project proposals. Applicant organizations must complete and maintain three registrations to be eligible to apply for or receive an award. These registrations include SAM.gov, Grants.gov, and eRA Commons. All registrations must be completed prior to the application being submitted. The complete registration process for all three systems can take 4 to 6 weeks, so applicants should begin this activity as soon as possible.

This NOFO contains information concerning the SSVF Program, the renewal and new applicant grant application processes, and the amount of funding available. Awards made for grants will fund operations beginning October 1, 2025. A. Purpose: The SSVF Program&#8217;s purpose is to provide supportive services grants to private non-profit organizations and consumer cooperatives who will coordinate or provide supportive services to very low-income Veteran families who (i) are residing in permanent housing and at risk of becoming homeless, (ii) are homeless and scheduled to become residents of permanent housing within a specified time period or (iii) after exiting permanent housing within a specified time period, are seeking other housing that is responsive to such low-income Veteran family&#8217;s needs and preferences. SSVF delivers services using a housing-first approach that emphasizes permanent housing placement and supportive services as the primary objectives. Housing First is an evidence-based, cost-effective approach to ending homelessness for the most vulnerable and chronically homeless individuals (https://www.usich.gov/tools-for-action/housing-first-checklist). SSVF prioritizes the delivery of rapid re-housing services to homeless Veteran households. Rapid re-housing is an intervention designed to help individuals and families quickly exit homelessness, return to housing in the community, and avoid homelessness again in the near term. The core components of a rapid re-housing program are housing identification, move-in and rent financial assistance, and rapid rehousing case management and services. These core components represent the minimum that a program must provide to households to be considered a rapid rehousing program. Applicants should familiarize themselves with the Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-housing Best Practice Standards found at https://www.va.gov/homeless/ssvf/index.html. B. Funding Priorities: The principal goal of this NOFO is to seek entities that have the greatest capacity to end homelessness among Veterans or sustain gains made in ending homelessness among Veterans. Priority will be given to grantees who can demonstrate the adoption of evidence-based practices in their application. Please note that the priorities for SSVF for fiscal year (FY) 2026 are different than in previous years. Under Priority 1, SSVF is introducing a new priority for FY 2026 to expand services to tribal and rural communities and the U.S. territories. VA has the ability to award up to a 3-year project period to tribal and rural communities and the U.S. territories under this NOFO. Indian tribe means a tribe that is a federally recognized tribe or a State recognized tribe. See 25 U.S.C. &#167; 4103(13). With this priority, SSVF is seeking Native-led organizations, organizations who are deeply invested in providing services on tribal lands and reservations, and organizations who have extensive experience working with Native Veterans and Veteran families. There is an emphasis on organizations that would serve the 29 tribal communities that have tribal Department of Housing and Urban Development &#8211; VA Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) (https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/hud_no_24_220). Rural communities are defined using the U.S. Department of Agriculture&#8217;s (USDA) definition of a rural area. Rural means: 1. Open countryside; 2. Rural towns (places with fewer than 5,000 people and 2,000 housing units); and 3. Urban areas with populations ranging up to 50,000 people that are not part of larger labor market areas (metropolitan areas) (https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/rural-economy-population/rural-classifications/). The U.S. territories are a priority including American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Priority 1 for FY 2026 is open to new and existing applicants; however, priority will be given to organizations that have a demonstrated track record of serving the tribal or rural community or the U.S. territory that they are proposing to serve. Additionally, applicants should have demonstrated cultural awareness and language access for the areas they are proposing to serve. Under Priority 2, VA will provide funding to existing grantees who have at least one of the following accreditations: 3-year accreditation from the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF) in Employment and Community Services: Rapid Rehousing and Homeless Prevention standards, a 4-year accreditation in Housing Stabilization and Community Living Services from the Council on Accreditation (COA), or a 3-year accreditation in The Joint Commission&#8217;s (JC) Behavioral Health Care: Housing Support Services Standards. Priority 2 applicants must demonstrate that accreditation is active at the date of submission, and accreditation must be maintained throughout the project period and/or funding cycle. Under Priority 3, existing SSVF grantees not included in Priority 2 but who have annual awards and are seeking to renew their grants, may apply. Existing grantees are SSVF grantees that have a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) for operations through September 30, 2025.",15.47,2025-01-14T16:44:21.0700000,2025-01-14T16:44:21.0700000,

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) &#8211; 2024 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2024. In this case &quot;omnibus&quot; means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates (Tables 2 and 3), a table that provides a very top level summary of proposal contents (Table 1), and the full text of the ROSES-2024 &quot;Summary of Solicitation&quot;, may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024. This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table3, respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under &quot;Announcement Documents&quot; the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH24ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on &#8220;C.8 Lunar Data Analysis Program (.pdf)&#8221; to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read &#8220;C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.pdf)&#8221; from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs. Questions concerning general ROSES-2024 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov, but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list.

This NOFO will encompass three Science Research Areas: 1) plant-soil-microbe interactions and their influence on belowground biogeochemical processes; 2) synthesis studies using existing data that address testing of ESS-relevant hypotheses and development of transferable insights into knowledge gaps for U.S. southeast coastal systems; and 3) synthesis studies on contributions and vulnerabilities of Earth system processes in marginal and degraded lands. The BER ESS program goal is to advance an integrated, robust, and scale-aware predictive understanding of terrestrial systems and their interdependent microbial, biogeochemical, ecological, hydrological, and physical processes. To support this goal, the program uses a systems approach to develop an integrative framework to elucidate the complex processes and controls on the structure, function, feedbacks, and dynamics of terrestrial and watershed systems, that span from molecular to global scales and extend from the bedrock through the soil, rhizosphere, and vegetation to the atmosphere. The ESS program scope advances foundational process knowledge with an emphasis on understudied ecosystems. Supported research emphasizes ecological and hydro-biogeochemical linkages among system components and characterization of processes across interfaces (e.g., terrestrial-aquatic, coastal, urban) to address key knowledge gaps and uncertainties across a range of spatial and temporal scales. Incorporation of scientific findings into process and system models is an important aspect of the ESS strategy, both to improve predictive understanding as well as to enable the identification of new research questions and directions.",20.55,2025-01-14T16:44:19.2400000,2025-01-14T16:44:19.2400000,

Subject to the availability of funding, Sea Grant anticipates that approximately $4,000,000 will be available for research projects and programs to create up to four Regional Collaboratives (one per region) focused on enhancing engagement of Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) in aquaculture, with up to $1,000,000 available for each. MSIs are defined as institutions of higher education that serve minority populations. For a list of institutions that are considered MSIs, please refer to the following link provided by NASA&apos;s MSI Exchange. The four regions in which Collaboratives are sought to be established (including states and territories) are: &#8226; West Coast/Alaska/Pacific (CA, OR, WA, AK, HI, GU, and other Pacific territories) &#8226; Southeast/GOM/Caribbean (TX, LA, MS, AL, FL, PR, US Virgin Islands, GA, SC, NC) &#8226; Northeast/mid-Atlantic (VA, MD, DE, NJ, NY, CT, RI, MA, NH, ME) &#8226; Great Lakes (NY, VT, PA, OH, IN, IL, MI, WI, MN) Successful proposals will address topical needs (described below) and integrate research and extension. Proposals are sought that will support collaborative, multi-SG Program efforts to enhance engagement and collaboration of Sea Grant programs and Minority Serving Institutions within each region in direct support of aquaculture activities of MSIs. While a regional approach is the required mechanism for achieving these goals, it is expected that the Regional Collaboratives will interact with one another to support shared National level interests. Proposals will preferably include participation and involvement of Sea Grant extension personnel and aquaculture community stakeholders. These investments are consistent with Sea Grant&#8217;s focus area of Sustainable Fisheries and Aquaculture (SFA) and the Sea Grant Network&#8217;s 10-year Aquaculture Vision, both which support NOAA and Department of Commerce aquaculture goals. The following entities are eligible to submit to this opportunity: Sea Grant College Programs, Sea Grant Institutional Programs and Sea Grant Coherent Area Programs. For the remainder of this document, these entities are collectively referred to as &#8220;Sea Grant Programs&#8221;. A Sea Grant Program may submit or be a part of more than one application. Applications involving multiple Sea Grant programs within a given region are strongly preferred. Programs are required to partner with MSIs as part of each Regional Collaborative. While it is the expectation of this competition that Sea Grant programs will partner with MSIs in their respective regions, it should be noted that all partnerships with MSIs need not be solidified by the NOFO deadline. It is envisioned that the Sea Grant program-led Collaboratives will continue to establish relationships/partnerships with MSIs throughout the award. It should be noted that, in addition to collaborations currently existing between Sea Grant programs and MSIs, Collaboratives should also strive to engage MSIs that have aquaculture programs or are interested in aquaculture, but have not collaborated with a Sea Grant program. Programs are encouraged to partner with other Sea Grant Programs as well as entities such as individuals, State and Tribal Agencies/Organizations, NGOs, aquaculture industry members and associations, universities, and colleges, including community colleges. Federal agencies and their personnel are not permitted to receive federal funding under this competition; however, federal scientists and other employees can serve as uncompensated partners or co-Principal Investigators on applications. Federal labs and offices can also make available specialized expertise, facilities or equipment to applicants but cannot be compensated under this competition for their use, nor can the value of such assets be used as match. All projects must take place within the United States or territories or their respective waterways. Applicants must complete and maintain three registrations to be eligible to apply for or receive an award. These registrations include SAM.gov, Grants.gov, and eRA Commons. All registrations must be completed prior to the application being submitted. The complete registration process for all three systems can take 4 to 6 weeks, so applicants should begin this activity as soon as possible.

Project Background, Goals, and Objectives The U.S. Mission to Kazakhstan launched the English Access Scholarship Program in 2007. Since its inception, over 2,500 students across more than 15 regions of Kazakhstan have participated in the program. The Access Program aims to enhance students&apos; ability to contribute to the socio-economic development of their communities and improve their prospects for engaging in educational and exchange opportunities in the United States. In response to growing interest in the program from rural areas and secondary school students in Kazakhstan, the U.S. Consulate General in Almaty is committed to continuing its support for local communities. This will be achieved through implementing partners located in Taldykorgan and Kyzylorda. This funding opportunity invites implementing organizations in these regions to design and deliver the Access Program through after-school classes and intensive sessions, benefiting a total of 60 talented 13-15-year-olds from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. The program requires 360 hours of English language instruction over a two-year period, which may include both classroom lessons and off-site activities that are clearly aligned with the curriculum. Additionally, the Access Program offers participants opportunities to engage with U.S. culture, global citizenship, and democratic values. It also provides professional development opportunities for teachers and administrators, as well as long-term benefits for alumni. Project Audience(s): The target audience for this program consists of bright and motivated students, aged 13 to 15, from secondary schools in Taldykorgan and Kyzylorda. The group should include an equal gender representation (50/50 ratio), with students coming from socially and economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Participants must demonstrate a strong interest in learning about U.S. culture and values. The program will be an intensive, in-person, two-year commitment, and students must be fully committed to attending and completing the program over its duration. Project Goal: The goal of the Access Program is to provide academically talented and motivated youth from economically disadvantaged backgrounds with the opportunity to enhance their English language skills, deepen their understanding of U.S. culture and democratic values, and develop leadership abilities. Through an intensive two-year curriculum, the program aims to empower participants to become active, informed global citizens, better equipped to pursue higher education, engage in cross-cultural exchanges, and contribute to the socio-economic development of their communities. Project Objectives: Objective 1: Provide at least 60 youth from low-income communities in Taldykorgan and Kyzylorda with enhanced English language skills through a two-year intensive program. Objective 2: Strengthen the teaching and leadership capabilities of Access English language instructors, fostering their professional growth and pedagogical effectiveness. Objective 3: Foster re-engagement with alumni of the Access Program in Taldykorgan and Kyzylorda, encouraging ongoing participation and support within the program&#8217;s community.

Increasing the housing supply is key to overcoming the housing affordability crisis in the United States. MMH is housing that ranges in size from Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) to duplexes, townhomes, and small-scale apartment buildings. MMH may be an effective tool to increase the supply of both market and affordable housing. However, it comprises only a small segment of the total housing stock. MMH development involves different characteristics and processes compared to other more common housing types. This makes it challenging to build MMH to scale. More research is needed to understand the prevalence and impact of financing and other non-zoning barriers to MMH construction. Research funded under this NOFO is intended to help HUD, state and local governments, and private stakeholders by achieving the following NOFO Study Objectives:Identify significant financing and other non-zoning barriers to producing MMH. This includes the ways these barriers prohibit producing MMH and the effect of these barriers on producing new housing units.Locate successful strategies at the federal, state, and local levels to overcome identified barriers. These might include, but are not limited to, financing solutions, policy levers, and technical assistance.Recommend strategies that are feasible, cost-effective, evidence-based, and may increase MMH supply. Proposed strategies should be relevant across a range of housing market conditions and jurisdiction types.Awards made under this NOFO will be cooperative agreements and, therefore, the awardee shall anticipate substantial involvement, as defined in Section III.A, by subject matter experts from the office of Policy Development &amp; Research (PD&amp;R).This NOFO is intended to fund proposals to research financing and other non-zoning barriers to increasing MMH supply.

Proposers must retrieve the instructions document (zip file) associated with the application package for this opportunity as there is at least one required form that must be attached to the submitted proposal package. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) &#8211; 2024 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2024. In this case &quot;omnibus&quot; means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates (Tables 2 and 3), a table that provides a very top level summary of proposal contents (Table 1), and the full text of the ROSES-2024 &quot;Summary of Solicitation&quot;, may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024. This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements.

On that page, on the right side under &quot;Announcement Documents&quot; the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH24ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on &#8220;C.8 Lunar Data Analysis Program (.pdf)&#8221; to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read &#8220;C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.pdf)&#8221; from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs. Questions concerning general ROSES-2024 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov, but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list.

Studies may be either hypothesis-generating (unbiased discovery) or hypothesis-testing in design and may utilize in vivo, in situ or in vitro experimental paradigms, e.g., model organisms or human cell-based assays. While behavioral paradigms and outcome measures can be incorporated into the research design to facilitate the characterization of intracellular, transcellular, and circuit mechanisms, these are neither required nor expected.

In this case &quot;omnibus&quot; means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates (Tables 2 and 3), a table that provides a very top level summary of proposal contents (Table 1), and the full text of the ROSES-2024 &quot;Summary of Solicitation&quot;, may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024.

On that page, on the right side under &quot;Announcement Documents&quot; the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH24ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on &#8220;C.8 Lunar Data Analysis Program (.pdf)&#8221; to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read &#8220;C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.pdf)&#8221; from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs. Questions concerning general ROSES-2024 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov, but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list.

NOAA anticipates up to $100 million will be available under this opportunity, of which up to 15% will be specifically available as direct awards and subawards to Indian tribes (as defined in 25 U.S.C. Section 5304(e)) and Native American organizations that represent Indian Tribes through formal legal agreements (e.g. tribal commissions, tribal consortia, tribal conservation districts, and tribal cooperatives). The remaining funding will be available to all eligible applicants. Funding will prioritize habitat restoration actions that: demonstrate significant impacts; rebuild productive and sustainable fisheries; contribute to the recovery and conservation of threatened and endangered species; promote climate-resilient ecosystems, especially in tribal, indigenous, and/or underserved communities; and improve economic vitality, including local employment. This solicitation is authorized under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Bipartisan Infrastructure Law) (BIL, Public Law 117-58), 135 STAT.1356 (Nov. 15, 2021). This funding opportunity seeks habitat restoration projects that enhance coastal resilience. Coastal areas support the nation&#8217;s largest and often fastest-growing population centers, as well as key natural assets. Strengthening coastal resilience means preparing and adapting coastal communities to mitigate the impacts of, and more quickly recover after, extreme weather events such as hurricanes, coastal storms, and flooding, as well as longer-term climate hazards, such as sea level rise. Habitat restoration and natural and nature-based infrastructure are critical to doing so, by protecting lives and property; sustaining commercial, recreational, and subsistence fishing; recovering threatened and endangered species; and maintaining and fostering vibrant coastal economies. This funding opportunity &#8211; along with other opportunities through programs such as the National Oceans and Coastal Security Fund, Climate Resilience Regional Challenge, Coastal Zone Management, National Estuarine Research Reserves, and Coastal Habitat Restoration and Resilience Grants for Tribes and Underserved Communities &#8211; aims to fund projects that support the overarching goal of enhancing coastal resilience. This funding opportunity is also aligned with actions outlined in the Biden-Harris Administration&#8217;s Ocean Climate Action Plan, including nature-based solutions that support natural coastal and ocean systems while reducing the impacts of climate threats. This funding opportunity will prioritize high-value, transformative projects that advance resilience and support habitat restoration. Applicants should address the following set of program priorities: 1) sustaining productive fisheries and strengthening ecosystem resilience; 2) enhancing community resilience to climate hazards and providing other co-benefits; 3) fostering regionally important habitat restoration; and 4) providing benefits to tribal, indigenous, and/or underserved communities, including through partnerships. This solicitation will fund projects that demonstrate high priority and transformative potential within the geographic region where restoration actions are proposed. Projects that are most responsive to the program priorities and are more transformative (i.e., have greater positive impact) will be more competitive. Proposals may include the following types of project phases: planning and assessments; feasibility studies; engineering design and permitting; on-the-ground implementation; pre- and/or post-implementation monitoring. Proposals may also include capacitybuilding and community engagement to support the proposed restoration. Applicants proposing preimplementation activities should demonstrate how these efforts will support or catalyze subsequent onthe-ground restoration. Proposals that include on-the-ground implementation will be given priority compared to those that include only pre-implementation activities. Proposals that include multiple sites should demonstrate how projects collectively contribute to the priorities within the same geographic area or watershed, and applicants should demonstrate the capacity to manage concurrent habitat restoration projects over multiple years. Priority will be given to activities with the highest certainty to occur within a 2-3 year award period. NOAA is committed to the goals of advancing equity and support for underserved communities. NOAA encourages applicants to include and demonstrate principles of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility through proactive, meaningful, and equitable community engagement in the identification, design, and/or implementation of proposed projects. NOAA also encourages applicants to propose projects with benefits to tribal, indigenous, and/or underserved communities, and projects that appropriately consider and elevate local or indigenous knowledge in project design, implementation, and evaluation. Applicants should identify if the project is located within tribal, indigenous, and/or underserved communities, and/or whether a portion of the resilience benefits from the proposed work will flow to tribal, indigenous, and/or underserved communities. This program will advance the Biden-Harris Administration&#8217;s Justice40 Initiative. Established by Executive Order 14008 on &#8220;Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad,&#8221; the Justice40 Initiative has established a goal that 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain federal investments in climate, clean energy, and other areas will flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized and overburdened by pollution and underinvestment. Proposals selected for funding through this solicitation will be funded through cooperative agreements. NOAA encourages a period of performance of up to three years, with the potential for up to five years, if necessary. NOAA anticipates typical federal funding for awards will range from $4 million to $6 million over three years. NOAA will not accept proposals with a federal funding request of less than $750,000 or more than $10 million total for the entire award. We only expect a small number of awards (between 3-5) that will be funded near or at the cap of $10 million. Funds will be administered by the NOAA Office of Habitat Conservation, as directed in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. ",18.33,2025-01-14T16:44:20.8600000,2025-01-14T16:44:20.8600000,

The program may be held in several locations to make it easier for participants. Proposals must have entrepreneurship programing or engagement activities for AWE alumnae from previous years. Funding Instrument Type: Grant or cooperative agreement. Cooperative agreements are different from grants in that bureau/embassy staff are more actively involved in the grant implementation (&#8220;Substantial Involvement&#8221;). Project Performance Period: Proposed projects should be completed in 12 months or less. The Department of State may entertain applications for continuation grants funded under these awards beyond the initial budget period on a non-competitive basis subject to availability of funds, satisfactory progress of the program, and a determination that continued funding would be in the best interest of the U.S. Department of State.[RP1] This notice is subject to availability of funding. Priority Region: Zimbabwe Program Description Program Goals: The U.S. Embassy Zimbabwe under the U.S. Department of State announces an open competition for organizations to submit applications to implement an Academy for Women Entrepreneurs (AWE) program in Zimbabwe. The Public Diplomacy Section invites proposals from non-profit organizations, civil society organizations, incubators, tech hubs, and U.S. government alumni organizations to design and implement an entrepreneurial program for women entrepreneurs to develop the skills, capabilities, and resources to fully participate in the private sector. Participants of the AWE program will participate in facilitated in-person and virtual sessions with established Zimbabwean and U.S. entrepreneurs, alumni of U.S.-funded exchange programs, and other experts from different fields that enrich the AWE program. Proposals must integrate the online interactive DreamBuilder course and may include elements from the online curriculum, the Najafi 100 Million Learners Global Initiative, on key topics in entrepreneurship and innovation as part of the proposal. The program may be held in several locations, run cohorts of up to 30 participants, and should have a strong American component, including U.S. experts as guest teachers or coaches, articulated in the proposed activities syllabus. Proposals must have entrepreneurship programing or engagement activities for AWE alumnae from previous years. Proposals that have site visits, seed funding, exchanges, pitch competitions, fairs, networking, or other creative engagement elements will be more competitive. Program Objectives: The proposals should meet the following objectives: Increase participants&#8217; understanding of business planning, financial forecasting, marketing, and scaling up operations; Connect participants with U.S. based business experts and share U.S. models of running enterprises; Foster a network that support female entrepreneurs through peer-to-peer mentorship to help grow businesses and drive local partnerships; and Equip women entrepreneurs with skills and knowledge to build sustainable businesses. Implementing partner proposals should have a detailed recruitment strategy for the target population, clearly specifying how the Embassy would be involved. The proposal should include ideas for follow-up activities with AWE alumni after program implementation to assess the impact of the program. Proposals with sustainability, business partnerships, and/or cost sharing built in will be more competitive. Budgets should be reasonable. Audience: The AWE program targets current or future women business owners in Zimbabwe. AWE participants must commit to complete the program, have proven computer skills, and have access to the Internet or a reliable data connection. Applicants are encouraged to develop programs for underrepresented populations, niche business sectors, or areas of potential growth.

Extractive industry activities of the past, including underground and surface mining and releases of hazardous substances from degraded watersheds and air-sheds on public lands throughout New Mexico, have contributed to degradation of natural resources. Unrestored sites may pose a threat to wildlife, biota, groundwater, surface water, and soil as well as to risks to the health and safety of public land users. This program supports projects funded through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), Public Law 117-169, Subtitle B- National Resources, Sections 50221, NPS and Public Lands Conservation and Resilience, and 50222, NPS and Public Lands Conservation and Ecosystem Restoration. This program supports projects funded through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), Sections 50221 Resilience, 50222 Ecosystems Restoration and 50303 DOI.Mitigation measures are implemented through core programs such as: the Abandoned Mine Lands (AML) program, which addresses physical safety hazards and contamination posing risk to human health and/or the environment through remediation and restoration of abandoned hardrock mines, and releases of hazardous substances, and educational outreach about the potential dangers posed to the public and recreation activities.The AML program identifies and inventories abandoned hardrock mines, prioritizes those mines that pose a risk to public safety, human health, and the environment, and seeks funding to address those high risk mine features and sites. Specifically, the AML program addresses physical safety hazards through a variety of closure methods including fencing, signing, back filling, installation of bat-friendly grates, etc., and addresses risks to human health and the environment through a variety of removal and remedial response actions. The AML and Natural Resource Damage and Restoration (NRD) programs also work to restore abandoned hardrock mines sites and restore the Nation&apos;s watersheds impacted by abandoned mines through a risk-reduction based watershed approach that uses partnerships to effectively leverage funding and facilitate projects; and reduces environmental degradation caused by abandoned mines to ensure compliance with all applicable soil, water, and air quality standards, and applicable Federal, State, Tribal, and local laws and regulations. For the NRD program, and any actions taken pursuant to BLM&#8217;s authority under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, potentially responsible parties must be investigated.The BLM estimates there are over 130,000 abandoned mine features located on BLM-administered land, many of which will need mitigation to protect human health and the environment, increase public safety and reduce environmental liabilities by eliminating or minimizing risk. In compliance with all applicable soil, water and air quality standards, and Federal State, Tribal and local laws and regulations, the BLM seeks to develop partnerships with States, local governments, Tribal Nations, and voluntary environmental and citizen groups. In addition, BLM seeks to return lands to productive uses including, but not limited to, recreation, fish and wildlife habitat, and preservation of historical/cultural resources. These partnerships will provide financial assistance, through cooperative agreements to protect surface water, groundwater, soil, sediment and air from abandoned mine sites, address releases of hazardous substances, safeguard dangerous mine sites, and restore sites.",16.07,2025-01-14T16:44:21.2670000,2025-01-14T16:44:21.2670000,

Eligible organizations must be legally recognized non-profits or non-governmental entities that comply with U.S. and Bangladeshi technical and legal standards for implementing Public Diplomacy programs, as outlined in Section B. The Academy for Women Entrepreneurs (AWE) equips women with the knowledge, tools, and connections needed to start and grow successful businesses. By fostering entrepreneurial skills and promoting financial independence, the program creates opportunities for women to overcome barriers to economic participation. With a focus on empowering women from underserved and marginalized communities, AWE prepares participants to thrive in the private sector and contribute meaningfully to their local economies. &#65279;1. Project Background, Goals, and Objectives The Academy for Women Entrepreneurs (AWE) was launched by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA) in 2019 to address the barriers women face in starting and scaling businesses. The program empowers women by providing access to practical, no-cost online business education and localized coaching and mentorship. It leverages platforms like DreamBuilder, created in partnership with Arizona State University&#8217;s Thunderbird School of Global Management and the Freeport-McMoRan Foundation, and the Najafi 100 Million Learners Global Initiative to deliver flexible, high-impact training in core business skills. AWE also fosters peer-to-peer learning, mentorship, and networking opportunities with U.S. exchange alumni and local business leaders. In Bangladesh, AWE addresses the critical challenges women entrepreneurs encounter, such as limited access to finance, professional networks, and structured business training. These challenges are compounded by socio-economic barriers that often restrict women&apos;s participation in the economy. Previous projects have demonstrated that combining U.S.-style online learning with localized facilitation and mentorship significantly enhances participants&apos; skills, confidence, and economic outcomes. AWE alumni have reported substantial improvements in their businesses, with 74% achieving higher incomes and 29% hiring additional staff, showcasing the program&apos;s potential to drive local prosperity. Participants in the AWE program will engage in facilitated in-person and virtual sessions with established Bangladeshi and U.S. entrepreneurs, alumni of U.S.-funded exchange programs, and other experts from diverse fields that enrich the program. Proposals must integrate the online interactive DreamBuilder course and may include elements from the Najafi 100 Million Learners Global Initiative curriculum, focusing on key topics in entrepreneurship and innovation. The program may be implemented in multiple locations, run cohorts of up to 30 participants, and must include a strong American component, such as U.S. experts serving as guest teachers or coaches, clearly articulated in the proposed syllabus. Proposals must also include engagement activities for AWE alumnae from previous years. These activities could include site visits, seed funding opportunities, exchanges, pitch competitions, fairs, networking, or other creative elements that encourage alumnae to remain connected and continue to grow their businesses. Proposals incorporating such innovative and interactive elements will be more competitive. Through this NOFO, the Public Diplomacy Section (PDS) seeks to expand on these successes by scaling the program&apos;s impact in Bangladesh. The goal is to empower a new generation of women entrepreneurs by equipping them with the skills, networks, and confidence needed to succeed. Success will be measured through participants&#8217; ability to apply learned skills, increase business profitability, generate jobs, and foster resilience in the face of challenges. This initiative aims to create sustainable economic growth and promote women&#8217;s leadership in entrepreneurship, contributing to Bangladesh&#8217;s broader socio-economic development. Project Audience(s): The Academy for Women Entrepreneurs (AWE) program targets aspiring women entrepreneurs from diverse and underrepresented backgrounds across Bangladesh. Primary beneficiaries include women from marginalized communities, rural and urban areas, and various educational and professional levels, ensuring an inclusive approach to fostering entrepreneurship. The program prioritizes those facing systemic barriers to economic participation, equipping them with skills, networks, and confidence to succeed.

Funding for this program comes from the Antiterrorism Emergency Reserve (the Emergency Reserve). Along with non-grant training and technical assistance services, there are four types of grants that may be combined into one application: crisis response, consequence management, criminal justice support, and crime victim compensation. AEAP grants are a mechanism by which the Director of OVC may award supplemental crime victim compensation and assistance to eligible entities responding to acts of mass criminal violence or domestic terrorism. The event must be sufficiently large that the jurisdiction cannot provide needed services to victims of the incident with existing resources, while also supporting victims of other crimes, in a timely and comprehensive manner. OVC generally accesses AEAP funds only in response to incidents that are sufficiently large in scope for the locale, and typically only where there was an unpredictable, indiscriminate, or broad targeting of victims, or otherwise unique aspect to the crime. In most cases, OVC expects States and communities to plan for and address victim needs stemming from relatively more predictable instances of gang-related violence, domestic violence, and broader community gun violence, from existing VOCA resources. AEAP funds may be used to provide emergency relief to benefit victims such as crisis response efforts, help victims adapt to and cope with the consequences of the event over the longer-term, and facilitate victim participation in the judicial process. AEAP can also supplement state crime victim compensation administrative agencies that reimburse victims for out-of-pocket expenses related to their victimization. Funding under this program is retroactive to the date of the incident. Justification for all funding must demonstrate that AEAP funds will support victims of the incident and are supplemental to existing resources. OVC may provide a no-cost consultant(s) to help the prospective grantee with the AEAP application process.",18.09,2025-01-14T16:44:21.6900000,2025-01-14T16:44:21.6900000,

Agency Overview: The Advanced Research Projects Agency &#8211; Energy (ARPA-E), an organization within the Department of Energy (DOE), is chartered by Congress in the America COMPETES Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-69), as amended by the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-358), as further amended by the Energy Act of 2020 (P.L. 116-260): &#8220;(A) to enhance the economic and energy security of the United States through the development of energy technologies that&#8212; (i) reduce imports of energy from foreign sources; (ii) reduce energy-related emissions, including greenhouse gases; (iii) improve the energy efficiency of all economic sectors; (iv) provide transformative solutions to improve the management, clean-up, and disposal of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel; and (v) improve the resilience, reliability, and security of infrastructure to produce, deliver, and store energy; and (B) to ensure that the United States maintains a technological lead in developing and deploying advanced energy technologies.&#8221; ARPA-E issues this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) under its authorizing statute codified at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 16538. The NOFO and any cooperative agreements or grants made under this NOFO are subject to 2 C.F.R. Part 200 as supplemented by 2 C.F.R. Part 910. ARPA-E funds research on, and the development of, transformative science and technology solutions to address the energy and environmental missions of the Department. The agency focuses on technologies that can be meaningfully advanced with a modest investment over a defined period of time in order to catalyze the translation from scientific discovery to early-stage technology. For the latest news and information about ARPA-E, its programs and the research projects currently supported, see: http://arpa-e.energy.gov/. ARPA-E funds transformational research. Existing energy technologies generally progress on established &#8220;learning curves&#8221; where refinements to a technology and the economies of scale that accrue as manufacturing and distribution develop drive improvements to the cost/performance metric in a gradual fashion. This continual improvement of a technology is important to its increased commercial deployment and is appropriately the focus of the private sector or the applied technology offices within DOE. In contrast, ARPA-E supports transformative research that has the potential to create fundamentally new learning curves. ARPA-E technology projects typically start with cost/performance estimates well above the level of an incumbent technology. Given the high risk inherent in these projects, many will fail to progress, but some may succeed in generating a new learning curve with a projected cost/performance metric that is significantly better than that of the incumbent technology. ARPA-E will provide support at the highest funding level only for submissions with significant technology risk, aggressive timetables, and careful management and mitigation of the associated risks. ARPA-E funds technology with the potential to be disruptive in the marketplace. The mere creation of a new learning curve does not ensure market penetration. Rather, the ultimate value of a technology is determined by the marketplace, and impactful technologies ultimately become disruptive &#8211; that is, they are widely adopted and displace existing technologies from the marketplace or create entirely new markets. ARPA-E understands that definitive proof of market disruption takes time, particularly for energy technologies. Therefore, ARPA-E funds the development of technologies that, if technically successful, have clear disruptive potential, e.g., by demonstrating capability for manufacturing at competitive cost and deployment at scale. ARPA-E funds applied research and development (R&amp;D). The Office of Management and Budget defines &#8220;applied research&#8221; as an &#8220;original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge&#8230;directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective&#8221; and defines &#8220;experimental development&#8221; as &#8220;creative and systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience, which is directed at producing new products or processes or improving existing products or processes.&#8221; Applicants interested in receiving financial assistance for basic research (defined by the Office of Management and Budget as &#8220;experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts&#8221;) should contact the DOE&#8217;s Office of Science (http://science.energy.gov/). Office of Science national scientific user facilities (http://science.energy.gov/user-facilities/) are open to all researchers, including ARPA-E Applicants and awardees. These facilities provide advanced tools of modern science including accelerators, colliders, supercomputers, light sources and neutron sources, as well as facilities for studying the nanoworld, the environment, and the atmosphere. Projects focused on early-stage R&amp;D for the improvement of technology along defined roadmaps may be more appropriate for support through the DOE applied energy offices including: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (http://www.eere.energy.gov/), the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (https://www.energy.gov/fecm/office-fossil-energy-and-carbon-management), the Office of Nuclear Energy (http://www.energy.gov/ne/office-nuclear-energy), and the Office of Electricity (https://www.energy.gov/oe/office-electricity). ARPA-E encourages submissions stemming from ideas that still require proof-of-concept R&amp;D efforts as well as those for which some proof-of-concept demonstration already exists. Submissions can propose a project with the end deliverable being an extremely creative, but partial solution. Program Overview: 1. SUMMARY The Disruptive dc Converters for Grid Resilient Infrastructure to Deliver Sustainable energy (DC-GRIDS) program will target transformative technologies that enable a multi-terminal high-voltage direct current (MT-HVDC) transmission macrogrid. It will enable multi-directional power routing, flexible interconnections between existing and new alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) lines, and the easier addition of sustainable energy sources. Furthermore, a MT-HVDC macrogrid would accelerate adoption of offshore power transmission, conversion of high-voltage alternating current (HVAC) corridors to HVDC, and interconnection of the three U.S. electrical grids. This program seeks to enable the rapid expansion of existing grid capacity, while improving resiliency and performance. 2. BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION HVDC lines transport electrical power more efficiently than HVAC lines over long distances, particularly in underground or subsea applications, and may allow for 3.5 times the capacity of existing HVAC rights-of-way. However, there are several barriers to w...",14.68,2025-01-14T16:44:19.4700000,2025-01-14T16:44:19.4700000,

AGENCY OVERVIEW The Advanced Research Projects Agency &#8211; Energy (ARPA-E), an organization within the Department of Energy (DOE), is chartered by Congress in the America COMPETES Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-69), as amended by the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-358), as further amended by the Energy Act of 2020 (P.L. 116-260): &#8220;(A) to enhance the economic and energy security of the United States through the development of energy technologies that&#8212; (i) reduce imports of energy from foreign sources; (ii) reduce energy-related emissions, including greenhouse gases; (iii) improve the energy efficiency of all economic sectors; (iv) provide transformative solutions to improve the management, clean-up, and disposal of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel; and (v) improve the resilience, reliability, and security of infrastructure to produce, deliver, and store energy; and (B) to ensure that the United States maintains a technological lead in developing and deploying advanced energy technologies.&#8221; ARPA-E issues this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) under its authorizing statute codified at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 16538. The NOFO and any cooperative agreements or grants made under this NOFO are subject to 2 C.F.R. Part 200 as supplemented by 2 C.F.R. Part 910. ARPA-E funds research on, and the development of, transformative science and technology solutions to address the energy and environmental missions of the Department. The agency focuses on technologies that can be meaningfully advanced with a modest investment over a defined period of time in order to catalyze the translation from scientific discovery to early-stage technology. For the latest news and information about ARPA-E, its programs and the research projects currently supported, see: http://arpa-e.energy.gov/. ARPA-E funds transformational research. Existing energy technologies generally progress on established &#8220;learning curves&#8221; where refinements to a technology and the economies of scale that accrue as manufacturing and distribution develop drive improvements to the cost/performance metric in a gradual fashion. This continual improvement of a technology is important to its increased commercial deployment and is appropriately the focus of the private sector or the applied technology offices within DOE. In contrast, ARPA-E supports transformative research that has the potential to create fundamentally new learning curves. ARPA-E technology projects typically start with cost/performance estimates well above the level of an incumbent technology. Given the high risk inherent in these projects, many will fail to progress, but some may succeed in generating a new learning curve with a projected cost/performance metric that is significantly better than that of the incumbent technology. ARPA-E will provide support at the highest funding level only for submissions with significant technology risk, aggressive timetables, and careful management and mitigation of the associated risks. ARPA-E funds technology with the potential to be disruptive in the marketplace. The mere creation of a new learning curve does not ensure market penetration. Rather, the ultimate value of a technology is determined by the marketplace, and impactful technologies ultimately become disruptive &#8211; that is, they are widely adopted and displace existing technologies from the marketplace or create entirely new markets. ARPA-E understands that definitive proof of market disruption takes time, particularly for energy technologies. Therefore, ARPA-E funds the development of technologies that, if technically successful, have clear disruptive potential, e.g., by demonstrating capability for manufacturing at competitive cost and deployment at scale. ARPA-E funds applied research and development (R&amp;D). The Office of Management and Budget defines &#8220;applied research&#8221; as an &#8220;original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge&#8230;directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective&#8221; and defines &#8220;experimental development&#8221; as &#8220;creative and systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience, which is directed at producing new products or processes or improving existing products or processes.&#8221; Applicants interested in receiving financial assistance for basic research (defined by the Office of Management and Budget as &#8220;experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts&#8221;)1 should contact the DOE&#8217;s Office of Science (http://science.energy.gov/). Office of Science national scientific user facilities (http://science.energy.gov/user-facilities/) are open to all researchers, including ARPA-E Applicants and awardees. These facilities provide advanced tools of modern science including accelerators, colliders, supercomputers, light sources and neutron sources, as well as facilities for studying the nanoworld, the environment, and the atmosphere. Projects focused on early-stage R&amp;D for the improvement of technology along defined roadmaps may be more appropriate for support through the DOE applied energy offices including: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (http://www.eere.energy.gov/), the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (https://www.energy.gov/fecm/office-fossil-energy-and-carbon-management), the Office of Nuclear Energy (http://www.energy.gov/ne/office-nuclear-energy), and the Office of Electricity (https://www.energy.gov/oe/office-electricity). ARPA-E encourages submissions stemming from ideas that still require proof-of-concept R&amp;D efforts as well as those for which some proof-of-concept demonstration already exists. Submissions can propose a project with the end deliverable being an extremely creative, but partial solution. PROGRAM OVERVIEW The Inspiring Generations of New Innovators to Impact Technologies in Energy (IGNIITE) 2025 program is designed to support a new cohort of early-career innovators to develop the most disruptive and unconventional ideas into transformative new technologies across the full spectrum of energy applications. This announcement is purposefully broad in technical scope, but eligibility is limited to early-career researchers as defined in Section II.A.

This RFI is not accepting applications for financial assistance. The purpose of this RFI is solely to solicit input for ARPA-E consideration to inform the possible formulation of future programs. Request for Information (RFI) on Nuclear Heat for Modular Process Intensification in Refineries and Petrochemical Plants The purpose of this RFI is to solicit input for a potential future ARPA-E program focused on improving the performance and efficiency of unit operations in refining and petrochemical plants by leveraging heat input from nuclear heat transfer fluids rather than from combustion. ARPA-E seeks information regarding transformative and implementable technologies to facilitate this integration. ARPA-E previously issued an RFI on Nuclear Hybrid and Non-Electricity Energy Systems, DE-FOA-0003011, in February 2023. Questions in this RFI reflect the refined scope of the potential program. ARPA-E has identified three areas of interest for using nuclear energy to decarbonize process heating demands in refineries and petrochemical plants: 1. Development of process-intensified reactors for endothermic processes; 2. Novel heat transfer and heat augmentation technologies; and 3. Process dynamics of incorporating a traditionally firm (nuclear) heat source with volatile demands. Coupling nuclear with oil and gas operations will require both technical and commercial innovation in areas such as process co-design and co-optimization, sensors, controls, and thermal buffering interface-component development while meeting reliability, availability, and durability metrics cost effectively. This RFI aims to gather information from interested and relevant stakeholders about opportunities and challenges in the technical, technology-to-market, and safety aspects of coupling of nuclear heat and/or power to industrial processes beyond pure power and/or steam production. The questions posed in the section below are based on the following program-level assumptions: &#8226; Nuclear heat or combined heat and power (CHP) is a viable route to decarbonizing industrial processes; &#8226; Regulatory approvals can be obtained on a predictable basis; &#8226; The associated nuclear fuel cycle (including waste processing and geologic disposal) can be reliably and economically defined and implemented; and &#8226; Warranty protection and insurability can be established.

GNA can be an effective tool to partner with a cooperating entity that is carrying out weed treatments, whether using herbicide, mechanical, or biological controls, in a coordinated cross boundary effort.Fuels Management &#8211; Mechanical treatments (e.g. thinning, piling, mastication, mowing) chemical and biological applications, and prescribed fire to protect communities at risk, improve wildfire resiliency, and provide a safe and effective wildfire response.Community Assistance &#8211; Projects across ownership boundaries with mutual benefit and the ability to leverage funds to complete work on the ground. Some treatments could include thinning around a community at risk, juniper removal to improve landscape resiliency.Forest Management &#8211; Conduct treatments to enhance resilience of forests to wildfire, insect, disease, and drought through density management.Rangeland plant restoration &#8211; Whether impacts are from wildfire, drought, or noxious weeds and invasive species, it is often necessary to aid the re-establishment of rangeland vegetation. This could entail development of plant materials, seed collection, site preparation, and seed or seedling planting. Native plant restoration is also often a cross boundary need and where a cooperating entity is conducting these activities, GNA can be used to conduct these activities on BLM managed lands.Wildlife movement, migration, and habitat connectivity &#8211; GNA can be used to facilitate cross-boundary cooperative habitat restoration and rangeland structural improvements to improve habitat connectivity and support unimpeded movement of wildlife populations across landscapes. Examples of cooperative habitat connectivity projects may include: cross-boundary work associated with fence removals or upgrades to reduce animal fatalities and movement barriers; invasive species control and reseeding or planting of native vegetation along migration corridors and stopover areas; and enhancement of water resource availability within important wildlife movement areas (i.e., development and protection of natural springs, removal of invasive riparian species to increase water availability, construction of guzzlers and other artificial water sources, wet meadow restoration, etc.).NEPA &#8211; GNA stipulates that the BLM decision cannot be delegated to a cooperating entity. However, a cooperating entity can provide assistance in conducting NEPA for a restoration project when it is a part of the overall project to implement Authorized Restoration Services.Riparian restoration &#8211; Restoration work following flood events, large washouts, or changes to riparian area form and function that support wildlife and livestock is often more effective when implemented throughout a stream reach in coordination with a cooperating entity and other federal agencies. GNA can be used to install headcut and erosion control structures, check dam repair and removal, leaking ditches, re-contouring, or re-vegetation to support stream banks.Targeted grazing &#8211; Targeted grazing (prescribed grazing or managed herbivory) is the carefully controlled grazing by livestock to accomplish specific vegetation management objectives. Livestock may be used as a means to improve land health through weed control, wildfire fuels reduction, and other restoration activities. Activities that are often needed to implement targeted grazing include installation of fence, installation of range improvements including enclosures, maintenance of improvements, and livestock and range monitoring.",14.68,2025-01-14T16:44:19.9000000,2025-01-14T16:44:19.9000000,

The motivation for this initiative is that much of current imaging research into the role of inflammation in cancer is largely based on in vitro and ex vivo methods with limited utilization of imaging approaches that could lead to significant new insights relevant to dynamic cancer and inflammation interactions. Utilization of molecular imaging probes in pre-clinical and clinical investigations for precise temporal resolution at the molecular and cellular level are valuable approaches for identification and characterization of in vivo inflammatory cellular physiology in cancers and of molecular changes in response to treatment. This FOA encourages applications that focus on developing integrated imaging approaches to interrogate the role of inflammation in cancer through strong cross-field collaboration between cancer basic science researchers and imaging scientists. These collaborations are expected to advance science and understanding of cancer inflammation interactions.,3.82,2025-01-14T16:44:19.4670000,2025-01-14T16:44:19.4670000,

An announcement is not related to this notice. The TIP Office is not accepting applications at this time. Please review the attached notice for full details. Background: The goal of PEMS is to measurably and substantially reduce the prevalence of human trafficking and the harms associated with the crime in targeted populations through innovative interventions driven by research, monitoring, evaluation, and learning, and the expansion of partnerships with government, academia, civil society organizations, international organizations and the private sector. The U.S. Congress has appropriated $25 million annually since 2016 for PEMS, with $200 million in funding obligated to date. The TIP Office intends to further build the evidence base around what interventions work effectively to address trafficking in persons through funding the implementation and rigorous evaluation of high-potential and high-impact promising interventions. The TIP Office intends to consider interventions that have some evidence pointing to their effectiveness which could benefit from an evaluation to validate the intervention approach and answer important research questions about what is effective in anti-trafficking in persons programming. The TIP Office will consider interventions that have shown promise but have not had the funding to be rigorously evaluated; interventions that have shown success in other fields but have not been adapted and tested as a human trafficking intervention; and interventions for which there is a design for programming supported by significant research, which have not yet had the funding to implement and evaluate. Local expertise will be considered critical for implementing projects under this future opportunity.

BER&#8217;s mission is to support transformative science and scientific user facilities to achieve a predictive understanding of complex biological, Earth, and environmental systems for energy and infrastructure security, independence, and prosperity. BER research furthermore advances the fundamental understanding of dynamic, physical, and biogeochemical processes required to systematically develop Earth system models that integrate across the atmosphere, land masses, oceans, sea ice, subsurface, and human systems. These science-based predictive tools and methods are critically needed to inform policies and plans for strengthening the security and resilience of critical infrastructure and natural resources. First launched as a program in FY 2023, CRCs extend DOE climate science and research capacity by supporting non-R1 Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) and non-R1 Emerging Research Institutions (ERIs) to address the needs for regional resilience; including new science to describe climate change induced impacts and recovery in natural, socioeconomic, and/or built systems and their intersections. CRCs also aim to foster capacity at regional and local scales by connecting with affected communities and stakeholders to translate basic research into actionable science to enhance climate resilience, as well as to identify research priorities for future DOE investments. CRCs form a nucleus for building and empowering a future pool of local talent and expertise, including young scientists, engineers, and technicians, to address local resilience challenges and inform equitable solutions. CRCs will leverage ongoing DOE climate science and capabilities that exist at currently supported DOE national laboratories and universities, and build two-way engagement between DOE funded research and community stakeholders for improved climate resilience responses.

TSGP negotiations are a dynamic, evolving, and tribally driven process that requires careful planning, preparation, and sharing of precise, up-to-date information by both Tribal and Federal parties. Because each Tribal situation is unique, a Tribe&#8217;s successful transition into the TSGP, or expansion of their current program, requires focused discussions between the Federal and Tribal negotiation teams about the Tribe&#8217;s specific health care concerns and plans. One of the hallmarks of the TSGP is the collaborative nature of the negotiations process, which is designed to: 1) enable a Tribe to set its own priorities when assuming responsibility for IHS Programs, Services, Functions, and Activities (PSFA); 2) observe and respect the government-to-government relationship between the U.S. and each Tribe; and 3) involve the active participation of both Tribal and IHS representatives, including the Office of Tribal Self-Governance. Negotiations are a method of determining and agreeing upon the terms and provisions of a Tribe&#8217;s Compact and FA, the implementation documents required for the Tribe to enter into the TSGP. The Compact sets forth the general terms of the government-to-government relationship between the Tribe and the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The FA: 1) describes the length of the agreement (whether it will be annual or multi-year); 2) identifies the PSFAs, or portions thereof, the Tribe will assume; 3) specifies the amount of funding associated with the Tribal assumption; and 4) includes terms required by Federal statutes and other terms agreed to by the parties. Both documents are required to participate in the TSGP and they are mutually negotiated agreements that become legally binding and mutually enforceable after both parties sign the documents. Either document can be renegotiated at the request of the Tribe.",8.97,2025-01-14T16:44:18.8200000,2025-01-14T16:44:18.8200000,

The theme for this initiative is Energy for Agility. Discovery science is needed today to achieve the energy resources required for the future integrated employment of Air and Space Forces, for power generation and optimization, and resilience to exposure.In the coming decades, we are expecting to witness groundbreaking innovations in energy generation (in traditional methods, nuclear methods, and alternative methods of fuel and power), mobile energy storage, and power distribution that will change the way we think about energy for our Air and Space systems.Regardless of the selection of power generation and power requirements of a system, power system engineering should push beyond reliance on electrical engineering power conditioning concepts, and applied mathematical methods are required to create foundational competency to optimize power efficiency that take into account system activities with variable durations, purposes, and environments. A rigorous coupling between kinetics, mechanics, and electrochemistry is required for the discovery of next generation batteries. The convergence of major advancements in precision multi-material manufacturing, high fidelity functional material simulation, full linkages between component-operational-campaign level modeling, self-learning artificial intelligence, and advanced platform and propulsion designs will lead to revolutionary changes in system design processes and will enable rapid revolutionary system optimization. Increased activities in space will bring new exposures to radiation from, for example, space and mobile energy/power sources together with extreme environments. This creates new demands for protecting systems, such as needs for protective coatings or gear, radiation hardening, or multi-functionality of materials, electronics, and systems. Questions will likely arise around human exposure and protection, as agile energy may create localized extreme environments and novel exposure challenges. Advances in fundamental chemistry, fundamental biology, or computational sciences may prompt novel opportunities in the convergence of biosciences with unconventional energy concepts.This opportunity seeks to fund proposals in four (4) specific topic areas.

The NOFO and any cooperative agreements or grants made under this NOFO are subject to 2 C.F.R. Part 200 as supplemented by 2 C.F.R. Part 910. ARPA-E funds research on, and the development of, transformative science and technology solutions to address the energy and environmental missions of the Department. The agency focuses on technologies that can be meaningfully advanced with a modest investment over a defined period of time in order to catalyze the translation from scientific discovery to early-stage technology. For the latest news and information about ARPA-E, its programs and the research projects currently supported, see: http://arpa-e.energy.gov/. ARPA-E funds transformational research. Existing energy technologies generally progress on established &#8220;learning curves&#8221; where refinements to a technology and the economies of scale that accrue as manufacturing and distribution develop drive improvements to the cost/performance metric in a gradual fashion. This continual improvement of a technology is important to its increased commercial deployment and is appropriately the focus of the private sector or the applied technology offices within DOE. In contrast, ARPA-E supports transformative research that has the potential to create fundamentally new learning curves. ARPA-E technology projects typically start with cost/performance estimates well above the level of an incumbent technology. Given the high risk inherent in these projects, many will fail to progress, but some may succeed in generating a new learning curve with a projected cost/performance metric that is significantly better than that of the incumbent technology. ARPA-E will provide support at the highest funding level only for submissions with significant technology risk, aggressive timetables, and careful management and mitigation of the associated risks. ARPA-E funds technology with the potential to be disruptive in the marketplace. The mere creation of a new learning curve does not ensure market penetration. Rather, the ultimate value of a technology is determined by the marketplace, and impactful technologies ultimately become disruptive &#8211; that is, they are widely adopted and displace existing technologies from the marketplace or create entirely new markets. ARPA-E understands that definitive proof of market disruption takes time, particularly for energy technologies. Therefore, ARPA-E funds the development of technologies that, if technically successful, have clear disruptive potential, e.g., by demonstrating capability for manufacturing at competitive cost and deployment at scale. ARPA-E funds applied research and development (R&amp;D). The Office of Management and Budget defines &#8220;applied research&#8221; as an &#8220;original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge&#8230;directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective&#8221; and defines &#8220;experimental development&#8221; as &#8220;creative and systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience, which is directed at producing new products or processes or improving existing products or processes.&#8221; Applicants interested in receiving financial assistance for basic research (defined by the Office of Management and Budget as &#8220;experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts&#8221;)1 should contact the DOE&#8217;s Office of Science (http://science.energy.gov/). Office of Science national scientific user facilities (http://science.energy.gov/user-facilities/) are open to all researchers, including ARPA-E Applicants and awardees. These facilities provide advanced tools of modern science including accelerators, colliders, supercomputers, light sources and neutron sources, as well as facilities for studying the nanoworld, the environment, and the atmosphere. Projects focused on early-stage R&amp;D for the improvement of technology along defined roadmaps may be more appropriate for support through the DOE applied energy offices including: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (http://www.eere.energy.gov/), the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (https://www.energy.gov/fecm/office-fossil-energy-and-carbon-management), the Office of Nuclear Energy (http://www.energy.gov/ne/office-nuclear-energy), and the Office of Electricity (https://www.energy.gov/oe/office-electricity). ARPA-E encourages submissions stemming from ideas that still require proof-of-concept R&amp;D efforts as well as those for which some proof-of-concept demonstration already exists. Submissions can propose a project with the end deliverable being an extremely creative, but partial solution. Program Overview: Projects funded under the Galvanizing Leaps in Advanced Super INsulating Glass (GLASING) program will develop high performance Insulated Glass Units (IGUs) to improve the energy efficiency of new and existing buildings. GLASING technologies will achieve more than three times the thermal performance of the widely used 50-year-old double-pane IGU technology at competitive cost and optical performance. Applications for GLASING technologies will include new and retrofit single- and double-hung windows, bay windows, casement windows, awning windows, skylights, etc. Residential and commercial buildings accounted for 39.1% of the primary energy used in the U.S. in 2021, and 38% of that energy was used for space heating and cooling. Approximately 35% of that heating and cooling energy was lost through the building envelope (e.g., windows, walls, doors, attic, and air leaks). Overall, windows were responsible for 8.6% of the total energy used in buildings. Compared to walls, which typically have R-values between R-10 and R-30, single-pane windows and double-pane IGUs have R-values between R-1 and R-3.5 and are thus often the cause of po...",15.63,2025-01-14T16:44:19.2300000,2025-01-14T16:44:19.2300000,

Information gained from this project will be utilized to assist in making forest management decisions and assess changes in forest resources. An initial forest resource survey has been completed for all of the Rivers Project Office lands and a second inventory completed for Pool 24. A comprehensive analysis and comparison of the two iterations of data has also been completed for Pool 24. Year 1 of this project will focus on additional forest inventories in Pool 25 of the Mississippi River. Year 2 will focus on additional forest inventories as well as a similar comparative analysis of the two iterations of forest inventory data in Pool 25. There is the potential requirement for additional forest inventories to take place to aid with data analysis, focusing on Mississippi River Pools 25, 26, and the Open River and the lower Illinois River. Monitoring forest conditions following forest management actions is important to evaluate their effectiveness. Forest management has been conducted by USACE on the UMRS for over 30 years, but follow-up monitoring has been lacking. Completed forest management actions include reforestation, interplanting, timber stand improvement (TSI), prescribed burning, and invasive species treatment. This project will include conducting forest management actions and evaluating the effects of those actions on forest stand health, composition, and regeneration. This project will also take advantage of lessons learned from recent forest management projects to refine and enhance the Upper Mississippi River Systemic Forest Stewardship Plan (Guyon et al., 2012). This plan is the guiding document used by USACE foresters on the Upper Mississippi River in developing synchronized forest management plans and prescriptions. Revision of this plan will include more detailed R&amp;D to develop desired forest conditions for different floodplain forest communities and stand structure and how this will meet the habitat requirements of species of concern. Identification of specific wildlife habitat requirements will be needed for species of concern to ensure that wildlife management objectives are being met through an active forest management program. Invasive species are one of the largest threats to habitat integrity of the floodplain forest resource. One example of these threats is Japanese hops. It is an annual invasive species that has greatly expanded its dominance in the floodplain over the past ten years. Hops grows rapidly and will completely dominate a forest canopy gap, greatly reducing natural reforestation. This project will look to identify innovative and economically feasible means to quickly reforest canopy gaps to reduce the impact of invasive species such as Japanese hops or reed canary grass. This project will also describe the current and projected impact of the Emerald Ash Borer on green ash, the second most dominant tree within RPO management areas. The objective will be the development of a Special Status Report that describes the impact following the loss of green ash from floodplain forests and potential for Japanese hops or other invasives to dominate the resulting canopy gaps.",10.40,2025-01-14T16:44:20.6300000,2025-01-14T16:44:20.6300000,

The Activity&#8217;s priority health areas are maternal and newborn health (MNH); family planning and reproductive health (FP/RH); child health; nutrition; tuberculosis (TB); and mental health. This Activity will build on prior USAID investments, particularly the Assistance to Families and Indigent Afghans to Thrive (AFIAT), the Urban Health Initiative (UHI), and the Local Health System Sustainability (LHSS) activities.The IHI Activity will focus on five high-density population provinces - Kabul, Kandahar, Nangarhar, Herat, and Balkh - with a total population of 12.2 million, which is approximately 25 percent of the total population of the country. These five provinces have a high disease burden, vulnerable populations, and limited access to health services due to distance, high costs, low awareness, and a shortage of female health care providers. Additionally, Kandahar, Herat and Nangarhar have recently received large numbers of Afghans returning from neighboring countries. These populations settle in urban areas for long periods of time before they go to their native provinces, resulting in increased stress to health and other social services.Within these provinces, the Activity will focus on the most vulnerable populations, particularly women, children and marginalized groups. Health workers at all levels also constitute an important beneficiary population due to their central role in providing quality and respectful health services. The Activity will engage men because of the critical role they play in family decision-making related to health.The IHI Activity will need to support a range of different health facilities such as speciality, regional and district hospitals; comprehensive and basic health centers; health posts; and private health facilities. Supporting the private sector is critical to improving access to and the quality of services in the five priority provinces of this Activity. Private facilities already serve a large proportion of the target population; offer opportunities to increase demand for commodities and services through social marketing programs; and some private for profit entities provide subsidized schemes for poor and needy populations to make health services more affordable.",10.48,2025-01-14T16:44:21.0630000,2025-01-14T16:44:21.0630000,

Agency Overview: The Advanced Research Projects Agency &#8211; Energy (ARPA-E), an organization within the Department of Energy (DOE), is chartered by Congress in the America COMPETES Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-69), as amended by the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-358), as further amended by the Energy Act of 2020 (P.L. 116-260): &#8220;(A) to enhance the economic and energy security of the United States through the development of energy technologies that&#8212; (i) reduce imports of energy from foreign sources; (ii) reduce energy-related emissions, including greenhouse gases; (iii) improve the energy efficiency of all economic sectors; (iv) provide transformative solutions to improve the management, clean-up, and disposal of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel; and (v) improve the resilience, reliability, and security of infrastructure to produce, deliver, and store energy; and (B) to ensure that the United States maintains a technological lead in developing and deploying advanced energy technologies.&#8221; ARPA-E issues this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) under its authorizing statute codified at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 16538. The NOFO and any cooperative agreements or grants made under this NOFO are subject to 2 C.F.R. Part 200 as supplemented by 2 C.F.R. Part 910. ARPA-E funds research on, and the development of, transformative science and technology solutions to address the energy and environmental missions of the Department. The agency focuses on technologies that can be meaningfully advanced with a modest investment over a defined period of time in order to catalyze the translation from scientific discovery to early-stage technology. For the latest news and information about ARPA-E, its programs and the research projects currently supported, see: http://arpa-e.energy.gov/. ARPA-E funds transformational research. Existing energy technologies generally progress on established &#8220;learning curves&#8221; where refinements to a technology and the economies of scale that accrue as manufacturing and distribution develop drive improvements to the cost/performance metric in a gradual fashion. This continual improvement of a technology is important to its increased commercial deployment and is appropriately the focus of the private sector or the applied technology offices within DOE. In contrast, ARPA-E supports transformative research that has the potential to create fundamentally new learning curves. ARPA-E technology projects typically start with cost/performance estimates well above the level of an incumbent technology. Given the high risk inherent in these projects, many will fail to progress, but some may succeed in generating a new learning curve with a projected cost/performance metric that is significantly better than that of the incumbent technology. ARPA-E will provide support at the highest funding level only for submissions with significant technology risk, aggressive timetables, and careful management and mitigation of the associated risks. ARPA-E funds technology with the potential to be disruptive in the marketplace. The mere creation of a new learning curve does not ensure market penetration. Rather, the ultimate value of a technology is determined by the marketplace, and impactful technologies ultimately become disruptive &#8211; that is, they are widely adopted and displace existing technologies from the marketplace or create entirely new markets. ARPA-E understands that definitive proof of market disruption takes time, particularly for energy technologies. Therefore, ARPA-E funds the development of technologies that, if technically successful, have clear disruptive potential, e.g., by demonstrating capability for manufacturing at competitive cost and deployment at scale. ARPA-E funds applied research and development (R&amp;D). The Office of Management and Budget defines &#8220;applied research&#8221; as an &#8220;original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge&#8230;directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective&#8221; and defines &#8220;experimental development&#8221; as &#8220;creative and systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience, which is directed at producing new products or processes or improving existing products or processes.&#8221; Applicants interested in receiving financial assistance for basic research (defined by the Office of Management and Budget as &#8220;experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts&#8221;) should contact the DOE&#8217;s Office of Science (http://science.energy.gov/). Office of Science national scientific user facilities (http://science.energy.gov/user-facilities/) are open to all researchers, including ARPA-E Applicants and awardees. These facilities provide advanced tools of modern science including accelerators, colliders, supercomputers, light sources and neutron sources, as well as facilities for studying the nanoworld, the environment, and the atmosphere. Projects focused on early-stage R&amp;D for the improvement of technology along defined roadmaps may be more appropriate for support through the DOE applied energy offices including: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (http://www.eere.energy.gov/), the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (https://www.energy.gov/fecm/office-fossil-energy-and-carbon-management), the Office of Nuclear Energy (http://www.energy.gov/ne/office-nuclear-energy), and the Office of Electricity (https://www.energy.gov/oe/office-electricity). ARPA-E encourages submissions stemming from ideas that still require proof-of-concept R&amp;D efforts as well as those for which some proof-of-concept demonstration already exists. Submissions can propose a project with the end deliverable being an extremely creative, but partial solution. Program Overview: The Quantum Computing for Computational Chemistry program (QC3) aims to harness the transformative power of quantum computing to accelerate energy innovation. Computation plays an essential role in modern R&amp;D, but classical computers struggle to simulate quantum systems with the speed, scale, and accuracy necessary to advance many commercial energy applications. This program will support the R&amp...",16.78,2025-01-14T16:44:19.0470000,2025-01-14T16:44:19.0470000,

A comprehensive understanding of the natural history of a condition is necessary to facilitate appropriate interventions for infants identified by newborn screening. Characterization of the sequence and timing of symptom development provides information crucial for developing targeted, age-appropriate treatments and for establishing a baseline against which to assess novel interventions. In addition, for some conditions, establishment of genotype-phenotype correlations may facilitate prediction of the clinical course; for others, identification of modifying genetic, epigenetic, or environmental factors may enhance understanding of clinical outcomes. Comprehensive data on the natural history of a condition will facilitate the fields ability to: 1) identify the underlying biological mechanisms; 2) understand the genetic and clinical heterogeneity and phenotypic expression of the condition; 3) improve diagnostic accuracy; 4) facilitate clinical trials by providing comprehensive natural history data; 5) prevent, manage, and treat symptoms and complications of the condition; 6) furnish physicians and families with needed support and predictive information about the condition; and 7) establish data collection systems or patient registries to collect longitudinal data (e.g., child/family outcomes following newborn screening).",3.93,2025-01-14T16:44:19.4670000,2025-01-14T16:44:19.4670000,

Additional details about the program requirements and expectations for BLCP recipients can be found in HRSA-25-040. Our goal is to strengthen BLCP recipients&#8217; ability to examine and treat respiratory diseases and pulmonary impairments in active and inactive U.S. coal miners. To that end, the BLDRC provides programmatic assistance and resources to help BLCP recipients use data analysis to better understand the health status and needs of U.S. coal miners. BLDRC support and data analysis contributes to advancing evidence-based models of health care for rural health care providers, including BLCP recipients and other health care providers serving rural populations. The BLDRC will work with BLCP recipients and stakeholders to address long-standing challenges and barriers to medical, outreach, educational, and benefits counseling services for U.S. coal miners. The BLDRC will also help collect and analyze information on the demographics and clinical status of coal miners with Coal Mine Dust Lung Diseases (CMDLD), or black lung diseases, especially Coal Workers Pneumoconiosis (CWP) and its most severe form, Progressive Massive Fibrosis (PMF).

AWE has empowered an estimated 25,000 women entrepreneurs in more than eighty countries.AWE uses a hybrid model that combines the online platform DreamBuilder, developed through a partnership between Arizona State University&#8217;s Thunderbird School of Global Management and global copper mining company Freeport-McMoRan, with in-class mentoring and facilitation. Through AWE, participants learn core business skills, then get together as a class to discuss the material with experienced implementers, local mentors, and U.S. Exchange Alumni. Partnerships with local NGOs, universities, and chambers of commerce offer women the opportunity to amplify their newly learned business skills and network with other businesspeople through speed mentoring, pitch competitions, and entrepreneurship fairs. AWE is only available in English and Spanish, though partners may conduct mentoring and facilitation in local languages.In the Philippines, the U.S. Embassy&#8217;s American Center Manila launched AWE in 2020. There are currently 456 AWE graduates in the Philippines with programs in Bacolod, Baguio, Bohol, Cebu, Manila, Marawi, Puerto Princesa, Quezon city, and Zamboanga del Sur. AWE graduates include women from internally displaced communities, fisherfolk, and victims of violence and natural disasters. AWE graduates also include sustainable development and eco-product innovators, agricultural researchers, and tech-based innovators.The proposals should meet the following objectives:&#8226; Run eight AWE cohorts of approximately 25-30 women. To ensure program sustainability and engagement with AWE graduates, cohorts must be located in Bacolod, Baguio, Bohol, Cebu, Manila, Puerto Princesa, Quezon City, and Zamboanga del Sur. At least five of these eight cohorts will be managed through a sub-award with the U.S. Embassy&#8217;s American Corners (https://ph.usembassy.gov/education/american-spaces/) and AWE alumnae.&#8226; Distribute subgrants to selected American Corners and AWE alumnae to run AWE as follows: eighty percent of funding after submitting a detailed timeline and work plan (including marketing strategy for the project); twenty percent after submitting the final report with detailed project results.&#8226; Design a three to four-month program of activities for eight cohorts, including online and in-person meetups, lectures, seminars, pitching competitions, grade consultation hours, and trade fairs, with mandatory program launch and graduation ceremonies. A calendar of activities for the twelve-month performance period must be provided.&#8226; Identify the target audience for the academy and determine how they can create a ripple effect to advance AWE in their communities, including a detailed recruitment process.&#8226; Identify at least two qualified facilitators per cohort and outline their qualifications for the role.&#8226; Demonstrate how past AWE graduates will be engaged as mentors or resource personnel to showcase the benefits of AWE and inspire the current cohort.&#8226; Develop a comprehensive plan to establish partnerships and collaborative activities with institutions that can contribute to AWE, such as local government units, universities, chambers of commerce, and think tanks.&#8226; Establish a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation plan that includes key performance indicators, reference point for measuring progress, data collection methods, and reporting and feedback mechanisms.",17.70,2025-01-14T16:44:20.8600000,2025-01-14T16:44:20.8600000,

See the full posting on NSPIRES for details. Proposers must retrieve the instructions document (zip file) associated with the application package for this opportunity as there is at least one required form that must be attached to the submitted proposal package. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) &#8211; 2024 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2024. In this case &quot;omnibus&quot; means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates (Tables 2 and 3), a table that provides a very top level summary of proposal contents (Table 1), and the full text of the ROSES-2024 &quot;Summary of Solicitation&quot;, may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024. This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table3, respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under &quot;Announcement Documents&quot; the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH24ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on &#8220;C.8 Lunar Data Analysis Program (.pdf)&#8221; to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read &#8220;C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.pdf)&#8221; from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs. Questions concerning general ROSES-2024 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov, but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list.

Agency Overview: The Advanced Research Projects Agency &#8211; Energy (ARPA-E), an organization within the Department of Energy (DOE), is chartered by Congress in the America COMPETES Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-69), as amended by the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-358), as further amended by the Energy Act of 2020 (P.L. 116-260): &#8220;(A) to enhance the economic and energy security of the United States through the development of energy technologies that&#8212; (i) reduce imports of energy from foreign sources; (ii) reduce energy-related emissions, including greenhouse gases; (iii) improve the energy efficiency of all economic sectors; (iv) provide transformative solutions to improve the management, clean-up, and disposal of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel; and (v) improve the resilience, reliability, and security of infrastructure to produce, deliver, and store energy; and (B) to ensure that the United States maintains a technological lead in developing and deploying advanced energy technologies.&#8221; ARPA-E issues this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) under its authorizing statute codified at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 16538. The NOFO and any cooperative agreements or grants made under this NOFO are subject to 2 C.F.R. Part 200 as supplemented by 2 C.F.R. Part 910. ARPA-E funds research on, and the development of, transformative science and technology solutions to address the energy and environmental missions of the Department. The agency focuses on technologies that can be meaningfully advanced with a modest investment over a defined period of time in order to catalyze the translation from scientific discovery to early-stage technology. For the latest news and information about ARPA-E, its programs and the research projects currently supported, see: http://arpa-e.energy.gov/. ARPA-E funds transformational research. Existing energy technologies generally progress on established &#8220;learning curves&#8221; where refinements to a technology and the economies of scale that accrue as manufacturing and distribution develop drive improvements to the cost/performance metric in a gradual fashion. This continual improvement of a technology is important to its increased commercial deployment and is appropriately the focus of the private sector or the applied technology offices within DOE. In contrast, ARPA-E supports transformative research that has the potential to create fundamentally new learning curves. ARPA-E technology projects typically start with cost/performance estimates well above the level of an incumbent technology. Given the high risk inherent in these projects, many will fail to progress, but some may succeed in generating a new learning curve with a projected cost/performance metric that is significantly better than that of the incumbent technology. ARPA-E will provide support at the highest funding level only for submissions with significant technology risk, aggressive timetables, and careful management and mitigation of the associated risks. ARPA-E funds technology with the potential to be disruptive in the marketplace. The mere creation of a new learning curve does not ensure market penetration. Rather, the ultimate value of a technology is determined by the marketplace, and impactful technologies ultimately become disruptive &#8211; that is, they are widely adopted and displace existing technologies from the marketplace or create entirely new markets. ARPA-E understands that definitive proof of market disruption takes time, particularly for energy technologies. Therefore, ARPA-E funds the development of technologies that, if technically successful, have clear disruptive potential, e.g., by demonstrating capability for manufacturing at competitive cost and deployment at scale. ARPA-E funds applied research and development (R&amp;D). The Office of Management and Budget defines &#8220;applied research&#8221; as an &#8220;original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge&#8230;directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective&#8221; and defines &#8220;experimental development&#8221; as &#8220;creative and systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience, which is directed at producing new products or processes or improving existing products or processes.&#8221; Applicants interested in receiving financial assistance for basic research (defined by the Office of Management and Budget as &#8220;experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts&#8221;) should contact the DOE&#8217;s Office of Science (http://science.energy.gov/). Office of Science national scientific user facilities (http://science.energy.gov/user-facilities/) are open to all researchers, including ARPA-E Applicants and awardees. These facilities provide advanced tools of modern science including accelerators, colliders, supercomputers, light sources and neutron sources, as well as facilities for studying the nanoworld, the environment, and the atmosphere. Projects focused on early-stage R&amp;D for the improvement of technology along defined roadmaps may be more appropriate for support through the DOE applied energy offices including: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (http://www.eere.energy.gov/), the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (https://www.energy.gov/fecm/office-fossil-energy-and-carbon-management), the Office of Nuclear Energy (http://www.energy.gov/ne/office-nuclear-energy), and the Office of Electricity (https://www.energy.gov/oe/office-electricity). ARPA-E encourages submissions stemming from ideas that still require proof-of-concept R&amp;D efforts as well as those for which some proof-of-concept demonstration already exists. Submissions can propose a project with the end deliverable being an extremely creative, but partial solution. The Realize Energy-rich Compound Opportunities Valorizing Extraction from Refuse waters (RECOVER) program seeks to develop technologies to concentrate and recover high value energy materials (ammonia and critical metals) from aqueous waste streams. The RECOVER program will enable the U.S. to fully replace imports of these high value energy materials with domestic sources, thereby enhancing energy security. The RECOVER program will also enable a 30% reduction in energy demand and a 70% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as compared to conventional production of high value energy materials. This will be achieved by eliminating energy demand for creating or mining high value energy materials, electrifying new recovery technologies, and preventing nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from wasted ammonia. The RECOVER program defines the aqueous waste stream as any unwanted aqueous byproduct of anthropogenic activities, and includes: &#8226; Municipal wastewater; &#8226; Animal feedlot retention basins/waste ponds; &#8...",19.39,2025-01-14T16:44:19.8970000,2025-01-14T16:44:19.8970000,

The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates (Tables 2 and 3), a table that provides a very top level summary of proposal contents (Table 1), and the full text of the ROSES-2024 &quot;Summary of Solicitation&quot;, may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024. This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table3, respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under &quot;Announcement Documents&quot; the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH24ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on &#8220;C.8 Lunar Data Analysis Program (.pdf)&#8221; to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read &#8220;C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.pdf)&#8221; from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs. Questions concerning general ROSES-2024 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov, but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list.

MCCI is a multi-ICO dissemination and implementation science initiative to advance health equity and end health disparities in racial/ethnic minority women and girls of reproductive age. Specifically, the Model Continuums of Care Initiative will apply the latest dissemination and implementationscience approaches to significantly reduce the prevalence and impact of multi-morbidity among racial/ethnic minority women and girls of reproductive age at risk and living with mental health disorders, substance use disorders, chronic stress, cardiopulmonary diseases, common metabolic disorders (e.g., diabetes), cancer, and HIV/AIDS. This concept proposes a continuum of care approach that integrates preventive health services, primary care, behavioral health, integrative care, and cardiopulmonary and endocrine specialties to fully address health care needs in each of these domains, and to have maximum impact on the overall health and well-being ofracial and ethnic minority and other underserved women and girls. While MCCI is not a maternal health initiative, women and girls ages 15-44 yrs. are centered because it is during the early reproductive period, i.e., adolescence, that multimorbidity typically begins and rapidly progresses, setting the stage for multiple chronic debilitating conditions in later life. Special emphasis will be placed on using stakeholder partnerships, provider training, and infrastructure changes to improve access for subgroups of racial/ethnic minority women and girls who currently have the least access to high quality health care (e.g., racial/ethnic minority women and girls living in low resource settings).",8.80,2025-01-14T16:44:21.0630000,2025-01-14T16:44:21.0630000,

Clinical studies supported may consist of acute or short-term procedures that are deemed Non-Significant Risk (NSR) by an Institutional Review Board (IRB), or Significant Risk (SR) studies that require an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) from the FDA, such as chronic implants. The clinical trial should provide data to answer key questions about the function or final design of a device. This final device design may require most, if not all, of the non-clinical testing on the path to more advanced clinical trials and market approval. The clinical trial is expected to provide information that cannot be practically obtained through additional non-clinical assessments (e.g., bench top or animal studies) due to the novelty of the device or its intended use. Activities supported by this Funding Opportunity include a small clinical trial to answer key questions about the function or final design of a device.As part of the BRAIN Initiative, NIH has initiated a Public-Private Partnership Program (BRAIN PPP) that includes agreements (Memoranda of Understanding, MOU) with a number of device manufacturers willing to make such devices available, including devices and capabilities not yet market approved but appropriate for clinical research. In general it is expected that the devices&apos; existing safety and utility data will be sufficient to enable new IRB NSR or FDA IDE approval without need for significant additional non-clinical data.

Funding will be used for fish passage that rebuilds productive and sustainable fisheries, contributes to the recovery and conservation of threatened and endangered species, enhances watershed health, promotes resilient ecosystems and communities, and increases tribal capacity to participate in fish passage barrier removal efforts while improving tribal commercial, recreational, subsistence and cultural practice opportunities. This funding opportunity announcement is authorized under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) Public Law 117-58). Applicants should address the following program priorities: 1. Achieving measurable and lasting benefits for migratory fish populations; 2. Enhancing community resilience to extreme weather and climate hazards and providing other cobenefits; 3. Fostering tribally important barrier removal efforts that benefit migratory fish; or 4. Increasing tribal organization fish passage capacity to support tribes in their role as managers and stewards of tribal trust resources for cultural, spiritual, economic, subsistence, and recreational purposes. Proposals submitted under this funding opportunity should describe how the proposed work will: 1. Contribute to the recovery of threatened and endangered species listed under the Endangered Species Act; 2. Sustain or help rebuild fish stocks and their prey managed under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act; 3. Improve passage to support native fish species of the Great Lakes; 4. Enhance the sustainability of saltwater recreational fisheries; 5. Enhance community resilience to climate hazards by removing or improving aging infrastructure and support other co-benefits; or 6. Support hydroelectric license surrender to remove dams that are no longer economically viable or provide significant public benefits. Proposed activities may include future project development and feasibility studies, engineering and design, permitting, on-the-ground fish passage restoration, pre- and post-removal implementation monitoring, community engagement, and outreach and education. This funding opportunity will also support building tribal capacity to participate in developing current and future fish passage projects. Applicants may apply for funding to support one or more of these activities. Priority will be given to activities with the highest certainty to occur within a 2-3 year award period. Proposals may include multiple locations and should demonstrate how multiple locations collectively contribute to priorities within a watershed or geographic area. Proposals that focus on the removal of barriers will score higher than proposals that install structures that require operations and maintenance. Proposals selected for funding through this funding opportunity will be funded through cooperative agreements. NOAA anticipates that the period of performance for most awards will be for three years. NOAA anticipates typical federal funding for awards will range from $500,000 to $4 million over three years.

Satellite observations using L-band, such as SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive), provide 40 km data every 2 to 3 days, while in-situ sensors provide point-scale measurements. The NGWOS program has expanded in-situ networks and adopted cosmic ray neutron sensing at Innovation Test Beds (ITB) across the country with the goal to generate soil moisture maps at 1 km scale daily. To develop and evaluate such products, more spatially continuous data sets are required, and such data can be obtained from an L-band sensor on a UAV platform.",15.34,2025-01-14T16:44:19.2370000,2025-01-14T16:44:19.2370000,

This NOFO is intended to support trials that: address a significant problem, such that the findings have potential to inform practice; are adequately powered to definitively answer the primary research question(s), with well-justified hypotheses supported by pilot data; and are designed to examine questions regarding mediators and moderators of effects. Consistent with the NIMH experimental therapeutics approach, this NOFO is intended to support effectiveness trials that explicitly address whether the intervention engages the target(s)/mechanism(s) presumed to underlie the intervention effects (i.e., the mechanism(s) that accounts for changes in clinical/functional outcomes, changes in provider behavior, improved access or continuity of services, etc.). The collaborative R01 mechanism provides support for multisite trials when two or more sites are necessary for completion of the trial (e.g., to increase sample size, accelerate recruitment, or increase sample diversity and representation).",6.91,2025-01-14T16:44:19.9030000,2025-01-14T16:44:19.9030000,

Funding for this program comes from the Antiterrorism Emergency Reserve (the Emergency Reserve). Along with non-grant training and technical assistance services, there are four types of grants that may be combined into one application: crisis response, consequence management, criminal justice support, and crime victim compensation. AEAP grants are a mechanism by which the Director of OVC may award supplemental crime victim compensation and assistance to eligible entities responding to acts of mass criminal violence or domestic terrorism. The event must be sufficiently large that the jurisdiction cannot provide needed services to victims of the incident with existing resources, while also supporting victims of other crimes, in a timely and comprehensive manner. OVC generally accesses AEAP funds only in response to incidents that are sufficiently large in scope for the locale, and typically only where there was an unpredictable, indiscriminate, or broad targeting of victims, or otherwise unique aspect to the crime. In most cases, OVC expects States and communities to plan for and address victim needs stemming from relatively more predictable instances of gang-related violence, domestic violence, and broader community gun violence, from existing VOCA resources. AEAP funds may be used to provide emergency relief to benefit victims such as crisis response efforts, help victims adapt to and cope with the consequences of the event over the longer-term, and facilitate victim participation in the judicial process. AEAP can also supplement state crime victim compensation administrative agencies that reimburse victims for out-of-pocket expenses related to their victimization. Funding under this program is retroactive to the date of the incident. Justification for all funding must demonstrate that AEAP funds will support victims of the incident and are supplemental to existing resources.

In this case &quot;omnibus&quot; means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates (Tables 2 and 3), a table that provides a very top level summary of proposal contents (Table 1), and the full text of the ROSES-2024 &quot;Summary of Solicitation&quot;, may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024. This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table3, respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under &quot;Announcement Documents&quot; the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH24ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on &#8220;C.8 Lunar Data Analysis Program (.pdf)&#8221; to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read &#8220;C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.pdf)&#8221; from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs. Questions concerning general ROSES-2024 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov, but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list.

In an ongoing effort to extend the conservation of natural and cultural resources beyond our park boundaries, the National Park Service American Battlefield Protection Program (NPS ABPP) promotes the preservation and interpretation of these important places. NPS ABPP supports community-driven stewardship of historic resources through four grant opportunities: Preservation Planning, Battlefield Restoration, Battlefield Interpretation, and Battlefield Land Acquisition.NPS ABPP administers Battlefield Land Acquisition Grants (BLAG) to assist State and local governments with the preservation of eligible Revolutionary War, War of 1812, and Civil War battlefield lands through acquisition of fee-simple or less-than-fee (easement) interests. Funding for the BLAG program is made available from the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) and is awarded competitively. Each grant requires a dollar-for-dollar non-Federal match. Grants are available to acquire interests in eligible Civil War battlefields listed in the Civil War sites Advisory Commission&apos;s (CWSAC) Report on the Nation&apos;s Civil War Battlefields (1993) and in the principal battlefields of the Revolutionary War and War of 1812 identified in NPS ABPP&#8217;s Report to Congress on the Historic Preservation of Revolutionary War and War of 1812 Sites in the United States (2007) (Survey Reports).In accordance with 54 U.S.C. &#167; 308103(b), Battlefield Acquisition Grant Program, this funding opportunity is limited to state or local governments. Nonprofit organizations may acquire an interest in an eligible site by partnering in an application from a state or local government which has jurisdiction over the property interest to be acquired. The government agency will be the grant recipient and serve as a pass-through entity for Federal funds to the nonprofit organization (2 C.F.R. &#167; 200.1).Applications are accepted and evaluated on a rolling basis. As our nation approaches the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence in 2026, NPS ABPP encourages projects that promote and expand preservation as well as enhance our understanding of the origins of the United States. NPS ABPP BLAG funds may not be used to acquire land or interests in land within the legislative boundary of a unit of the National Park System. Grant recipients are required to provide for public access and enjoyment of lands or interests in lands acquired with NPS ABPP funds in a manner consistent with the preservation goals of the program.

As described in the Action Plan, the maritime industry cannot rely solely on drop-in fuel replacements, so vessels must look towards alternative energy sources such as clean methanol, ammonia, hydrogen, electrification, and efficiency improvements as the industry moves towards zero- and near zero-emission fuels. This action is key to evaluating many subsequent goals in the plan pertaining to future production volumes of SMFs. It will also help to align community, industry, government, financiers, and other maritime stakeholders regarding what qualifies as a SMF. This alignment will help to advance technology and investment with a consistent understanding of future maritime fuels. This Request for Information (RFI) seeks to engage industry, government, and maritime stakeholders for feedback on how to define &#8220;Sustainable Maritime Fuel.&#8221; While this RFI is being published by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), DOE is also working with other agencies to support the development of an SMF definition; these agencies include but are not limited to the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Department of State, and the Environmental Protection Agency. This collaborative effort seeks feedback on a variety of aspects that may affect the eventual SMF definition, including but not necessarily limited to: minimum carbon intensity reductions, sustainability factors, criteria air pollutant inclusion (e.g. NOx, SOx, and particulate matter), acceptable feedstocks, how to align with global requirements (e.g. International Maritime Organization (IMO) and FuelEU), and whether accounting for emission reduction technologies (such as onboard carbon capture) should be included. Responses to this RFI must be submitted electronically to DefiningSMF@ee.doe.gov no later than 5:00pm (ET) on February 28, 2025. Responses must be provided as attachments to an email. It is recommended that attachments with file sizes exceeding 25MB be compressed (i.e., zipped) to ensure message delivery.

The first goal of this funding opportunity is to encourage the scientific study of theories, frameworks, and models for the translation and diffusion of knowledge, especially between fields and across contexts and levels-of-analysis (e.g., biological to cognitive/socioemotional to behavioral; individual to classroom to broader demographic variables; lab to classroom to school to district). The second goal is to advance or move specific practice, research or scientific discovery in STEM education reciprocally along the research-practice continuum. The Translation and Diffusion (TD) solicitation invites four types of proposals: Research on Translation or Diffusion proposals request funding to conduct scholarship that will advance the sciences of translation or diffusion of fundamental research knowledge toward PreK-12 formal STEM education practice by developing or refining theories, frameworks, or models (or adapting those from other domains) and conducting related research. Such proposals may also address the leveraging of effective classroom practices toward the enrichment of foundational research, constructs and models. We note that bi-directional movement across boundaries is a mutually beneficial reciprocal process. Proof-of-Concept Research proposals request funding to explore the feasibility and viability of particular knowledge or products generated from STEM education research toward advancing practice in formal PreK-12 settings (even if it is still basic or applied research and development rather than implementation). The goals are to facilitate the process by which the promise that the initial insight holds for research and practice can be realized. The outcome of such a project would lay the methodological, theoretical, empirical, design, or social foundation for conducting systematic work at the next stage of development or at the next level of analysis. Empirical and theory-building efforts to adapt initial insights from research or practice across significantly different contexts, populations, domains, and levels-of-analysis are also welcome. Synthesis proposals critically integrate the current state of knowledge on a particular topic relevant to translation and diffusion in formal PreK-12 STEM education. Such proposals should include the state of the knowledge across disciplinary communities and across relevant literatures, identify the lacunae in STEM education knowledge, and, where appropriate, lay out thenext steps for future research and development. Conference / Workshop proposals relevant to the call are also welcome.",12.89,2025-01-14T16:44:21.2700000,2025-01-14T16:44:21.2700000,

Agency Overview: The Advanced Research Projects Agency &#8211; Energy (ARPA-E), an organization within the Department of Energy (DOE), is chartered by Congress in the America COMPETES Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-69), as amended by the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-358), as further amended by the Energy Act of 2020 (P.L. 116-260): &#8220;(A) to enhance the economic and energy security of the United States through the development of energy technologies that&#8212; (i) reduce imports of energy from foreign sources; (ii) reduce energy-related emissions, including greenhouse gases; (iii) improve the energy efficiency of all economic sectors; (iv) provide transformative solutions to improve the management, clean-up, and disposal of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel; and (v) improve the resilience, reliability, and security of infrastructure to produce, deliver, and store energy; and (B) to ensure that the United States maintains a technological lead in developing and deploying advanced energy technologies.&#8221; ARPA-E issues this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) under its authorizing statute codified at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 16538. The NOFO and any cooperative agreements or grants made under this NOFO are subject to 2 C.F.R. Part 200 as supplemented by 2 C.F.R. Part 910. ARPA-E funds research on, and the development of, transformative science and technology solutions to address the energy and environmental missions of the Department. The agency focuses on technologies that can be meaningfully advanced with a modest investment over a defined period of time in order to catalyze the translation from scientific discovery to early-stage technology. For the latest news and information about ARPA-E, its programs and the research projects currently supported, see: http://arpa-e.energy.gov/. ARPA-E funds transformational research. Existing energy technologies generally progress on established &#8220;learning curves&#8221; where refinements to a technology and the economies of scale that accrue as manufacturing and distribution develop drive improvements to the cost/performance metric in a gradual fashion. This continual improvement of a technology is important to its increased commercial deployment and is appropriately the focus of the private sector or the applied technology offices within DOE. In contrast, ARPA-E supports transformative research that has the potential to create fundamentally new learning curves. ARPA-E technology projects typically start with cost/performance estimates well above the level of an incumbent technology. Given the high risk inherent in these projects, many will fail to progress, but some may succeed in generating a new learning curve with a projected cost/performance metric that is significantly better than that of the incumbent technology. ARPA-E will provide support at the highest funding level only for submissions with significant technology risk, aggressive timetables, and careful management and mitigation of the associated risks. ARPA-E funds technology with the potential to be disruptive in the marketplace. The mere creation of a new learning curve does not ensure market penetration. Rather, the ultimate value of a technology is determined by the marketplace, and impactful technologies ultimately become disruptive &#8211; that is, they are widely adopted and displace existing technologies from the marketplace or create entirely new markets. ARPA-E understands that definitive proof of market disruption takes time, particularly for energy technologies. Therefore, ARPA-E funds the development of technologies that, if technically successful, have clear disruptive potential, e.g., by demonstrating capability for manufacturing at competitive cost and deployment at scale. ARPA-E funds applied research and development (R&amp;D). The Office of Management and Budget defines &#8220;applied research&#8221; as an &#8220;original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge&#8230;directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective&#8221; and defines &#8220;experimental development&#8221; as &#8220;creative and systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience, which is directed at producing new products or processes or improving existing products or processes.&#8221; Applicants interested in receiving financial assistance for basic research (defined by the Office of Management and Budget as &#8220;experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts&#8221;) should contact the DOE&#8217;s Office of Science (http://science.energy.gov/). Office of Science national scientific user facilities (http://science.energy.gov/user-facilities/) are open to all researchers, including ARPA-E Applicants and awardees. These facilities provide advanced tools of modern science including accelerators, colliders, supercomputers, light sources and neutron sources, as well as facilities for studying the nanoworld, the environment, and the atmosphere. Projects focused on early-stage R&amp;D for the improvement of technology along defined roadmaps may be more appropriate for support through the DOE applied energy offices including: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (http://www.eere.energy.gov/), the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (https://www.energy.gov/fecm/office-fossil-energy-and-carbon-management), the Office of Nuclear Energy (http://www.energy.gov/ne/office-nuclear-energy), and the Office of Electricity (https://www.energy.gov/oe/office-electricity). ARPA-E encourages submissions stemming from ideas that still require proof-of-concept R&amp;D efforts as well as those for which some proof-of-concept demonstration already exists. Submissions can propose a project with the end deliverable being an extremely creative, but partial solution. Program Overview: The Realize Energy-rich Compound Opportunities Valorizing Extraction from Refuse waters (RECOVER) program seeks to develop technologies to concentrate and recover high value energy materials (ammonia and critical metals) from aqueous waste streams. The RECOVER program will enable the U.S. to fully replace imports of these high value energy materials with domestic sources, thereby enhancing energy security. The RECOVER program will also enable a 30% reduction in energy demand and a 70% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as compared to conventional production of high value energy materials. This will be achieved by eliminating energy demand for creating or mining high value energy materials, electrifying new recovery technologies, and preventing nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from wasted ammonia. 1. BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION The RECOVER program defines the aqueous waste stream as any unwanted aqueous byproduct of anthropogenic activities, and includes: &#8226; Municipal wastewater; &#8226; Animal feedlot retention basins/waste ponds; &#8226; Oil and gas flowback, and produced water; and &#8226; Mining drainage, discharge, and tailing ponds. High value energy materials under consideration includ...",16.73,2025-01-14T16:44:19.8970000,2025-01-14T16:44:19.8970000,

Please follow all instructions below. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION The U.S. Department of State Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA) established the Academy for Women Entrepreneurs in 2019 to provide women with the knowledge, networks, and access they need to launch or scale successful businesses: https://eca.state.gov/awe By promoting women&#8217;s economic opportunities and ensuring that women have the capabilities and resources needed to participate in the economy, the AWE program directly supports the U.S. National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality. AWE uses a hybrid model that combines the online platform DreamBuilder (developed through a partnership between Arizona State University&#8217;s Thunderbird School of Global Management and global copper mining company Freeport-McMoRan) with online and/or in-class mentoring and facilitation. Through AWE, participants learn core business skills, then get together as a class to discuss the material with experienced implementers, local mentors, and U.S. Exchange Alumni. Partnerships with local NGOs, universities, and chambers of commerce offer women the opportunity to amplify their newly learned business skills and network with other businesspeople through speed mentoring, pitch competitions, and entrepreneurship fairs. Applicants may also use a new online curriculum, in whole or in part &#8211; the Najafi 100 Million Learners Global Initiative &#8211; alongside or instead of DreamBuilder. At a local level, AWE harnesses the power of public-private sponsors, local partnerships, and U.S. Exchange Alumni networks to help women and their businesses grow. By giving women the tools and the confidence they need, the AWE program is generating income and creating jobs in women-led businesses, driving local prosperity in more than 100 countries worldwide. Program Objectives: Provide resources for English-speaking female entrepreneurs of Georgia to engage in U.S-style online and/or in-person education with guided facilitation from USG exchange alumni, local business leaders, or other local partners. Foster networks that support participants&#8217; access to peer-to-peer mentors, business partners, and scaling opportunities with businesses in the region and in the United States. Engage AWE alumni with volunteer, professional, and educational opportunities in ways to promote business expansion. Share lessons and practices from the United States with new businesses operating in the Georgian entrepreneurial ecosystems and prepare them for potential collaboration with U.S. clients, customers, and investors. The project also aims to empower women entrepreneurs in Georgia to fulfill their economic potential, and in doing so, create conditions for a more prosperous society. Participants and Audiences: Female entrepreneurs of Georgia ",18.16,2025-01-14T16:44:21.6900000,2025-01-14T16:44:21.6900000,
