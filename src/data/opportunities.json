It is anticipated that this program will support fundamental studies designed to identify and define the molecular mechanisms through which lipid metabolism mediates tumor growth and progression, focusing specifically on the central role lipids play in linking diet with the biology of cancer; bridge the historically divided fields of nutrition and molecular metabolism; and stimulate research and tool development in this emerging area, which faces particular challenges because of the complexity of lipid biochemistry. For this announcement, unpublished preliminary data are limited to one figure, comprising no more than one-half page, to facilitate the entry of qualified new investigators to the field.",

HIV Associated CNS (central nervous system) co-morbidities continue to exist despite excellent virologic control in this compartment. HIV persistence and neuroinflammation also continues to observed in the CNS in the setting of ART. HIV targets the CNS early in infection, and HIV-infected individuals suffer from mild forms of neurological impairments even under antiretroviral therapy (ART). CD4+ T cells and monocytes mediate HIV entry into the brain and constitute a source for HIV persistence and neuronal damage. CD8+ T cells are also massively recruited in the CNS in acute infection to control viral replication.",

This FOA supports basic, translational, and clinical research projects that seek to identify the mechanisms of therapy-induced adverse sequelae, clinically characterize the adverse sequelae, or translate the mechanistic understanding into therapeutic approaches to prevent or minimize the development of long-term sequelae. Research projects should focus on mechanistic studies with translational endpoints and longitudinal clinical phenotyping to identify and validate clinical endpoints (biomarkers, imaging, patient-reported outcomes, or combined elements) for future use in clinical trials that will evaluate the efficacy of interventions designed to prevent or reduce specific adverse sequelae.",

Requests should focus on a goal or capability that significantly adds to the current U.S. capacity to support advanced reactor R&amp;D, education, and workforce development. Applicants must demonstrate the connection among requested pieces of equipment or other project elements toward a key objective or outcome. Applications made of several uncorrelated equipment requests are not of interest. A request should not duplicate existing capabilities. Activities that involve the planning or construction of new university nuclear reactors will not be considered.

January 6, 2025 Funding Overview The Childcare Access and Nutrition Systems (CANS) Grant Program is funded through a cooperative agreement between the U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development (USDA RD) and the Southeast Crescent Regional Commission (SCRC). USDA Rural Business Cooperative Service provided the funding to SCRC to advance regional food and childcare systems in the distressed-identified rural counties of Dougherty and Upson, Georgia. The SCRC geographic area stretches from the Tidewater part of eastern Virginia southward through the Carolinas along Interstate 95, west through Georgia and lower Alabama, and northwesterly to the Mississippi Delta. According to a recent Wallet Hub economic study, Georgia is the sixth most financially distressed state in the country and has the ninth most people with accounts in distress and the 10th highest average number of accounts in distress across the United States. Georgia&#8217;s Southeast Crescent region is mostly rural, offering natural beauty, a distinct cultural heritage and relative proximity to metropolitan Atlanta, which is the leading economic driver of the state. While most counties in Georgia are economically distressed, the changing demographics of the region, ranging from high-growth areas to those that are losing population, require special interventions and policies to help close the region&#8217;s development and economic growth gap. This grant program will support rural Georgia communities&#8217; economic development efforts and maintain and improve a healthy Georgia population by leveraging funding assistance from the USDA RD to key Administration priorities, such as advancing racial equity place-based growth, and opportunity by ensuring rural residents in the most distressed communities in Georgia have equitable access to RD programs and benefit from RD funded projects. Funding Strategy &#8226; Target Multiple Sectors: The strategic investment in childcare will support an increase in workforce participation. Comparable investment in food production and sustainable farming ends food insecurity and supports sustainability, while positively contributing to multiple facets of rural life. &#8226; Increase Local Food Production: By engaging local farms and food related businesses, and encouraging sustainable food system practices, these projects will support job creation, economic growth, and better health outcomes. Local food production can improve regional self-sufficiency and contribute to long-term economic stability. &#8226; Leverage Employer and Community Partnerships: Through employer and community partnerships, these projects will encourage local support, thus ensuring that both businesses and communities have a stake in the success of the project and its broader implications. &#8226; Scalable Impact: Funded projects will offer an investment in local communities while impacting a broader audience. By expanding access to stronger local food systems and improving access to childcare services, these projects address immediate infrastructure needs, building a foundation for long-term community resilience.

States, territories, and Tribal governments will purchase local, unprocessed or minimally processed domestic foods from local producers, targeting historically underserved farmers/producers/fishers and small businesses including processors, aggregators, and distributors. Food purchased will target distribution to underserved communities. In addition to increasing local food consumption, funds are expected to help build and expand economic opportunity for local and historically underserved farmers/producers/fishers and small businesses including processors, aggregators, and distributors.AMS encourages projects that benefit historically underserved farmers/producers/fishers and small businesses, provide food distribution to underserved communities that are not part of the normal food distribution networks, and incorporate culturally relevant foods, including kosher and halal, as appropriate based on community preferences. For cooperative agreements intending to serve these entities, recipients should engage and involve those beneficiaries when developing their Project Summary. AMS would like these relationships and purchase and distribution channels to continue past the conclusion of this program. USDA will provide the State, territory, or Tribal government funding for food purchases as well as guidance, technical assistance, instruction, and monitoring throughout the life cycle of the cooperative agreement.Funding can only be used for food procurement. Recipients may not request direct or indirect costs associated with developing or administering the program. All food purchased must be unprocessed or minimally processed, and must meet the definitions of domestic and local, as defined in section 1.2.1 of the Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO). See section 4.6.2 &#8220;Allowable and unallowable costs and activities&#8221; of the NOFO for more information.$100 million in funding will be available for Tribal agreements, $50 million of which will be allocated for Tribes enrolled in past rounds of LFPA, the remaining $50 million will be allocated to Tribes that have not previously participated in the LFPA program. The remainder of the funds, $371.5 million will be available to state governments and territories. These funds will be awarded through a non-competitive process. Funds awarded to States and territories will be based on the statutory The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) funding formula. This formula considers the poverty rate and unemployment levels in each state to ensure the distribution of funds corresponds to feeding needs in each state. Cooperative Agreements will be awarded based on acceptability of the Project Summary and the ability of the recipient to meet the goals of the program.",

These novel workflows will be developed by coupling the latest advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) with high-throughput experimentation (HTE) to verifiably complete 10&#8211;15 years of traditional catalysis R&amp;D work within 12&#8211;18 months, thus achieving more than a ten-time acceleration in the catalyst development cycle.[1] The program will then use these new tools to discover and optimize catalytic chemistries relevant to ARPA-E&#8217;s goals.
